One widely regarded method for reducing strike mortality is operational mitigation, or curtailment, where turbine operation is restricted at low wind speeds. Despite an increasing number of studies in the Northern Hemisphere demonstrating curtailment effectiveness, no empirical studies have yet been conducted in Australia. This paper reports the findings of a curtailment study implemented at the Cape Nelson North wind farm in southwest Victoria, Australia. Conservation detection dog teams conducted mortality surveys between January and April in 2018 (before; pre-curtailment) and 2019 (after; during curtailment). Results were consistent with similar studies in the USA and Europe, as curtailment significantly reduced pooled species mortality by 54%. Bat calls did not decline during the study period, and thus were not an explanation for the reduction in fatalities. This study demonstrates that curtailment is a valid method for reducing bat turbine collision in south-eastern Australia. Consideration should be given to curtailment as a means to reduce bat turbine impacts in Australia, particularly at sites with known endangered and threatened populations, as we act to reduce anthropogenic climate change and its time-sensitive negative consequences.",intervention,Australia,66,0,0,3,10,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,SEP,2022,47,6,10.1111/aec.13220,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.13220,,22-Jul,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology

J,"Hull, CL; Muir, S",Search areas for monitoring bird and bat carcasses at wind farms using a Monte-Carlo model,AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,English,Article,bird and bat monitoring; wind farms,MORTALITY,"A regularly raised concern for wind farms is the number of species and rate of bird and bat collisions with turbines. Australian regulators require, at some operating wind farms, the monitoring of bird and bat collisions. Although monitoring is becoming more commonplace, the area recommended for searching beneath turbines is inconsistent, with many guidelines both in Australia and overseas being based on conjecture rather than empirical evidence. This has the potential to bias survey results, reduce confidence in the data collected, and preclude meaningful comparisons between sites. By having a measure of the range of the fall zone of a bird or bat, a survey can be designed that ensures that an adequate area is being searched and that the cost of searching outside the area where birds and bats can fall is minimised. This article outlines a model that describes the fall zone of bats and birds of various sizes after colliding with different sized turbines, by applying a Monte-Carlo approach to ballistics theory. The modelling results are benchmarked with data from two Australian wind farms and one from the USA, for which data were available. The results indicate the size of the search area required around already constructed turbines, and the search area required to estimate levels of background mortality for control zones for pre-commission mortality surveys.",research,"Australia, United States of America",32,45,47,1,29,AUSTRALAS J ENV MAN,Australas.

Despite being integral in ongoing investigations as well as regulatory approvals, the state-of-the-art method for the detection of fatalities remains a manual search by humans or dogs. This is expensive, time consuming and the efficiency varies greatly among different studies. Therefore, we developed a methodology for the automatic detection using visual/near-infrared cameras for daytime and thermal cameras for nighttime. The cameras can be installed in the nacelle of wind turbines and monitor the area below. The methodology is centered around software that analyzes the images in real time using pixel-wise and region-based methods. We found that the structural similarity is the most important measure for the decision about a detection. Phantom drop tests in the actual wind test field with the system installed on 75 m above the ground resulted in a sensitivity of 75.6% for the nighttime detection and 84.3% for the daylight detection. The night camera detected 2.47 false positives per hour using a time window designed for our phantom drop tests. However, in real applications this time window can be extended to eliminate false positives caused by nightly active animals. Excluding these from our data reduced the false positive rate to 0.05. The daylight camera detected 0.20 false positives per hour. Our proposed method has the advantages of being more consistent, more objective, less time consuming, and less expensive than manual search methods.",research,Austria,28,0,0,0,10,J IMAGING,J.

During migration, many man-made obstacles, such as wind farms, can pose a collision risk for bats. As it is known that bats can fly over open sea during migration, and offshore wind farms can also be problematic. We studied the presence of bats during migration at several North Sea locations with the aim of understanding the weather conditions triggering bat migration at sea. Our results show a decrease in bat activity with distance from the coast and a correlation between bat migration and wind speed (negative), wind direction, temperature (positive), and atmospheric pressure (positive). Understanding these relationships can help in reducing the effects of offshore wind farms by periodically idling the blades when optimal meteorological conditions prevail and by opting for wind farm locations where bat activity is less prevalent. Bats undertaking seasonal migration between summer roosts and wintering areas can cross large areas of open sea. Given the known impact of onshore wind turbines on bats, concerns were raised on whether offshore wind farms pose risks to bats. Better comprehension of the phenology and weather conditions of offshore bat migration are considered as research priorities for bat conservation and provide a scientific basis for mitigating the impact of offshore wind turbines on bats. This study investigated the weather conditions linked to the migratory activity of Pipistrellus bats at multiple near- and offshore locations in the Belgian part of the North Sea. We found a positive relationship between migratory activity and ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure and a negative relationship with wind speed. The activity was highest with a wind direction between NE and SE, which may favor offshore migration towards the UK. Further, we found a clear negative relationship between the number of detections and the distance from the coast. At the nearshore survey location, the number of detections was up to 24 times higher compared to the offshore locations. Our results can support mitigation strategies to reduce offshore wind farm effects on bats and offer guidance in the siting process of new offshore wind farms.",research,Belgium,37,2,2,2,14,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,DEC,2021,11,12,10.3390/ani11123457,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11123457,,,13,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology

During migration, many bats even cross the North Sea. The developments of offshore wind farms in the North Sea could therefore pose a collision risk for migrating bats. While bats have been observed inside offshore wind farms, their activity at turbine rotor height yet remains unknown. We therefore installed acoustic bat detectors at wind turbines in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Seven detectors were installed on the service platform of the transition piece (16 m above mean sea level) and four were installed on the nacelle of the turbines, in the centre of the rotor swept area (93 m above mean sea level). A total of 151 recordings of call sequences of Pipistrellus nathusii (Nathusius' pipistrelle) were made during 20 nights over an entire autumn migration season (8 August - 30 November 2017). 45 recordings contained more than 10 calls. These were further investigated for behavioural clues. We identified 32 recordings of animals in transit and 10 sequences of animals passing by while simultaneously exploring. Only three detections contained feeding buzzes and/or intense exploratory behaviour. The number of recordings at 93 m were around 10% of the number of recordings made at 16 m. This indicates that the activity of P. nathusii at our study site, measured at that particular altitude is low. Our observations therefore suggest that the collision risk might be lower than what could be expected from low altitude observations. However, a low number of recordings at nacelle height does not necessarily mean that only a low number of bats will collide with the turbines. The activity in the outer parts of the rotor swept zone, outside the detection range of our acoustic detectors, remains unknown and should be further investigated.",research,Belgium,37,4,4,1,13,ACTA CHIROPTEROL,Acta Chiropt.,DEC,2019,21,2,10.3161/15081109ACC2019.21.2.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15081109ACC2019.21.2.009,,,8,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology

Changes in megadiverse environments should be accompanied by studies that describe and predict the effects of these changes on ecosystems, underpinning the avoidance or at least the reduction of impacts and species conservation. Wind farm impacts on bats are scarcely known in Brazil. To fulfill this gap on spatiotemporal patterns in bat fatalities in a wind complex in southern Brazil were analysed. Monthly surveys were done around 129 wind towers in search for bat carcasses between 2014 and 2018. The number of specimens found per species was analysed in annual sets and also seasonally to understand the influence of land use in the spatial pattern of bat fatalities. The activity of aerial insectivore bats was monitored using ultrasound detectors and modelled using Generalized Linear Models (GLM), using meteorological variables as predictors. As a result of 48 months of surveys, 266 carcasses of six insectivorous bat species were recorded. The highest number of fatalities belonged to Tadarida brasiliensis. Fatalities occurred exclusively between October and May (Austral Spring to Austral Autumn), mainly in towers near the closest urban centre. Most fatalities occurred in the first (69%) and fourth (17%) years of operation; fatalities were positively related to wind speed. Eighty-three percent of the bat activity occurred between 15 degrees C and 23 degrees C. To minimize fatalities of synanthropic bat species such as T. brasiliensis, we suggest that wind complexes should be located at least 4 km distant from the urban centres, where those species roost. Moreover, between December and March, when most species from subtropical and temperate South America reproduce, wind towers located closer to known roosts should shut down on warmer nights, when bats are more active.",research,Brazil,73,3,3,1,6,HYSTRIX,Hystrix,,2020,31,1,10.4404/hystrix-00256-2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.4404/hystrix-00256-2019,,,8,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology

Wind power is necessary but, as any other source of energy, it has environmental impacts, especially on bats. Due to such rapid expansion and the volume of investiments on course, an analysis of the current environmental licensing of wind farms in Brazil is necessary. Here we compared normatives from Brazil with similar ones from Portugal, the United States and Canada. By using 21 driving questions, we detected that there is no an international standard in the licensing of wind farms, ranging from simplified to rigorous approaches, from mandatory to voluntary normatives. Despite having specific and mandatory legislation dated from 2014, Brazil's federal and state normatives have a vague and relaxed approach regarding the possible impacts of wind farms on bats. Larger wind parks can be fractioned in smaller units, licensed based on simplified and less rigorous studies, but with no explanation on how or when such fractionating may occur, neither details on when adopt it. Only Brazilian legislations do not clearly specify the procedures and the minimum necessary effort for pre and post-installation, and which should be the mitigation measures adopted for the impacts of wind farms. The Brazilian federal and state normatives must be revised and until that, the current EIA procedures should be seen as insufficient to accurately determine the real impact of wind farms on the Brazilian bat fauna.

Some of the carcasses may go undetected by search teams or be removed by scavengers during search intervals, so these biases must be evaluated and taken into account in fatality estimation. We investigated the influence of different factors on searcher efficiency and scavenger removal in a dry forest area in northeastern Brazil, one of the regions with the highest density of wind turbines in the Neotropics. We conducted searcher efficiency and scavenger removal trials around 34 wind turbines from January 2017 to January 2018. Searcher efficiency was influenced by cover type, season, and carcass size, ranging between 12% for small bats in shrub vegetation during the rainy season and 96% for large bats in absent or sparse vegetation during the dry season. Carcass type and season affected scavenger removal; carcass persistence time was shorter for chicks (1.2 days) than for bats and mice (2.1 days), and the probability of a carcass persisting for a whole day was higher in the rainy season, while the probability of carcass persistence for 7, 14, and 28 days was higher in the dry season. The scavenger community was composed of canids, birds of prey, and insects, with systematic removal of carcasses by the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous) throughout the year and by dung beetles in the rainy season. Based on our findings, impact assessments of wind facilities on bats should conduct searcher efficiency trials in all seasons and cover types around wind turbines, using bat carcasses or models of different sizes. Scavenger removal trials should cover all seasons as well, and use mouse carcasses (but not chick carcasses) as surrogates for bats.",research,Brazil,105,1,1,1,5,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J. Wildl.

Northeastern Brazil concentrates one of the world's largest wind potentials and has thousands of wind turbines in operation. In spite of this scenario, there is a lack of basic information, such as the presence of bat species and their activity patterns in those wind farms. We used passive acoustic monitoring to assess species richness and species composition and obtain data on activity patterns of insectivorous bats in four wind farm complexes in northeastern Brazil. We also investigated the possible correlation between environmental variables (wind speed and direction, air temperature and humidity, and percentage of moon illumination) and bat activity.

By altering when turbine rotors begin turning in low winds, either by changing the wind-speed trigger at which the turbine rotors are allowed to begin turning or by altering blade angles to reduce rotor speed, blades were near motionless in low wind speeds, which resulted in a significant reduction in bat fatalities (by 60.0% or 57.5%, respectively).

Several approaches to mitigating the impacts of wind energy development on bat populations have been developed, including curtailing wind turbine operation at night during lower wind speeds when bats are thought to be more active. Blanket curtailment approaches have shown substantial promise in reducing bat fatalities at wind energy facilities, but they also reduce the amount of energy extracted from the wind by turbines. A related approach, referred to as smart curtailment, uses bat activity and other variables to predict when bats will be at the greatest risk at a given wind facility. In some contexts, a smart curtailment approach might reduce bat fatalities while also reducing energy loss relative to blanket curtailment. However, it has not been clear how to compare blanket curtailment and smart curtailment approaches in terms of annual energy production at wind facilities. Here, we describe a new approach to simulating the influence of blanket and smart curtailment approaches on energy production at wind energy facilities, and demonstrate the approach using 6 wind energy development areas in the Canadian province of Alberta.

On average, 15.5 +/- 3.8 (95% CI) bats were killed per turbine per year at these sites (range = 0-103 bats/turbine/yr at individual wind farms). Based on 4,019 installed turbines (the no. installed in Canada by Dec 2013), an estimated 47,400 bats (95% CI = 32,100-62,700) are killed by wind turbines each year in Canada. Installed wind capacity is growing rapidly in Canada, and is predicted to increase approximately 3.5-fold over the next 15 years, which could lead to direct mortality of approximately 166,000 bats/year. Long-distance migratory bat species (e.g., hoary bat [Lasiurus cinereus], silver-haired bat [Lasionycteris noctivagans], eastern red bat [Lasiurus borealis]) accounted for 73% of all mortalities.

Numerous hypotheses have been proposed, including a feeding-attraction hypothesis that suggests bats may be attracted to insects congregating near turbine nacelles. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed echolocation calls of hoary (Lasiurus cinereus) and silver-haired (Lasionycteris noctivagans) bats recorded over 72 nights at a wind energy facility in Southern Alberta, Canada. We recorded calls at 3 heights: 67 m at turbine nacelles, 30 m at meteorological towers, and ground level at turbines and meteorological towers. We used feeding buzzes as indicators of foraging behavior. We compared the occurrence of feeding buzzes across heights, and between turbines and meteorological towers to test the prediction that if bats are attracted to turbines for foraging, there will be a greater proportion of feeding buzzes at turbines, and in particular, at nacelle height. We found no significant evidence that foraging rates were higher at nacelle height compared to 30 m or ground level, or between turbines and meteorological towers for either species. For silver-haired bats, foraging activity was greater at meteorological towers, and in particular, at 30 m height. These results do not support the feeding-attraction hypothesis for silver-haired or hoary bats, and suggest that while some bats forage in the vicinity of wind turbines, they are not specifically attracted to turbines to feed.",research,Canada,40,9,9,8,52,J MAMMAL,J.

Thus, most information regarding their migratory behavior is anecdotal. Recently, however, fatalities of migratory bats at some wind energy facilities across North America have provided the opportunity and impetus to study bat migration at fine spatial and temporal scales. Using acoustic monitoring and carcass searches, we examined temporal and spatial variation in activity levels and fatality rates of bats at a wind energy facility in southern Alberta, Canada. Our goals were to better understand the influence of weather variables and turbine location on the activity and fatality of hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), and to use that understanding to predict variation in fatality rates at wind energy facilities and recommend measures to reduce fatalities. Overall activity of migratory bats and of silver-haired bats increased in low wind speeds and warm ambient temperatures, and was reduced when the wind was from the North or Northeast, whereas hoary bat activity increased with falling barometric pressure. Fatalities of migratory bats in general increased with increased activity of migratory bats, increased moon illumination, and falling barometric pressure and were influenced by the interaction between barometric pressure change and activity. Fatalities of silver-haired bats increased with increased activity, moon illumination, and winds from the south-east. Hoary bat fatalities increased with falling barometric pressure. Our results indicate that both the activity and fatality of migratory bats are affected by weather variables, but that species differ in their responses to environmental conditions. Spatially, fatalities were not influenced by the position of turbines within a turbine row, but were influenced by the location of turbines within the facility. Our findings have implications for our understanding of bat migration and efforts to reduce fatalities at wind energy facilities. To maximize the reduction of bat fatalities, operators of wind energy facilities could incorporate migratory bats' response to environmental variables, such as barometric pressure and fraction of moon illuminated, into their existing mitigation strategies.

To date, the population-level effects of wind-related mortality have been estimated for only 1 bat species. To estimate temporal trends in bat abundance, we considered wind turbines as opportunistic sampling tools for flying bats (analogous to fishing nets), where catch per unit effort (carcass abundance per monitored turbine) is a proxy for aerial abundance of bats, after accounting for seasonal variation in activity. We used a large, standardized data set of records of bat carcasses from 594 turbines in southern Ontario, Canada, and corrected these data to account for surveyor efficiency and scavenger removal. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate temporal trends in aerial abundance of bats and to explore the effect of spatial factors, including landscape features associated with bat habitat (e.g., wetlands, croplands, and forested lands), on the number of mortalities for each species. The models showed a rapid decline in the abundance of 4 species in our study area; declines in capture of carcasses over 7 years ranged from 65% (big brown bat [Eptesicus fuscusl) to 91% (silver-haired bat [Lasionycteris noctivagansl). Estimated declines were independent of the effects of mitigation (increasing wind speed at which turbines begin to generate electricity from 3.5 to 5.5 m/s), which significantly reduced but did not eliminate bat mortality. Late-summer mortality of hoary (Lasiurus cinereus), eastern red (Lasiurus borealis), and silver-haired bats was predicted by woodlot cover, and mortality of big brown bats decreased with increasing elevation. These landscape predictors of bat mortality can inform the siting of future wind energy operations. Our most important result is the apparent decline in abundance of four common species of bat in the airspace, which requires further investigation.",research,Canada,58,12,12,4,39,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Using acoustic monitoring and carcass searches, we examined variation in activity levels and fatality rates of bats across southern Alberta, Canada, to determine if bat activity and fatality are concentrated in certain areas or evenly distributed across the landscape. To investigate geographical variation in bat activity, we acoustically monitored activity from 15 July to 15 September 2006 and 2007 at 7 proposed or existing wind energy installations across southern Alberta (similar to 155 km between the most westerly wind energy facility and the most easterly). Activity of migratory bats varied among sites, suggesting that, rather than migrating in a dispersed way across a broad area, bats concentrate along select routes. To investigate variation in bat fatality rates among wind energy installations, we compiled fatality data collected between 2001 and 2007 from 6 wind energy facilities and conducted carcass searches at 3 wind energy installations in 2006 and 2007. Fatality rates differed among the 9 sites, partly due to differences in turbine height, but also due to differences in migratory-bat activity and the interaction between bat activity and turbine height.

While this may be troubling from a population perspective, these fatalities provide an opportunity to learn more about bat migration and the origins and summer distributions of migratory bats by using endogenous markers. Such markers include stable isotope values, which have been used to answer questions about ecological systems, such as trophic levels and food webs, and the origins and migratory routes of animals. To estimate the origins of migratory bats, we determined nitrogen (delta N-15), carbon (delta C-13), and hydrogen (delta H-2) stable isotope values of fur (delta N-15(f), delta C-13(f), delta H-2(f), respectively) from hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) killed at a wind energy facility in southern Alberta, Canada. We determined that mean isotope values varied among species, year, sex, and age class. delta C-13(f) and delta H-2(f) values indicated that silver-haired bats likely originated in the boreal forest, farther north and/or at higher elevations than the aspen parkland-like habitat suggested by the isotope values of hoary bats. IsoMAP analysis indicated that bat fatalities may have originated from a large catchment area potentially hundreds of kilometers away. Our data provide further evidence for a migration route along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains that is used by bats from across Alberta and beyond, and suggest that fatalities at a single wind energy site have the potential to have far-reaching ecological and population consequences.",research,Canada,81,38,41,0,81,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,SEP,2014,5,9,10.1890/ES13-00380.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES13-00380.1,,,17,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology

Given Canada's expected increase in wind energy capacity, consideration of the potential adverse impacts to bird and bat populations is prudent given their sensitivity to these projects. The province of Ontario, Canada is currently the leading jurisdiction for wind energy development, and for provincial guidance on pre- and post-construction monitoring. With uniform monitoring guidance in Ontario, wind energy proponents, and third-party consultants, have developed post-construction monitoring protocols that meet provincial guidance, while also providing standardized reporting. In Atlantic Canada, post construction guidelines vary between provinces, depending mostly on guidance from the Environment Canada Canadian Wildlife Service and relevant provincial agencies. To ensure quality post-construction monitoring results in Atlantic Canada and other provinces, it is imperative that all Canadian provinces adopt similar approaches to those employed in Ontario.

While wind energy is a low-cost option for new electricity supply, the impacts to wildlife populations, including bats (Chiroptera), are of ecological concern. To quantify these impacts, scientists have developed estimator equations to estimate bat mortality, which vary in assumptions related to correction factors. We compared the results of 4 estimators applied to post-construction monitoring data from Ontario, Canada, wind farms to evaluate the effects of field methods and correction factors on estimator consistency. To conduct our study, we obtained data from 21 wind farms between 2011 and 2017 for a total of 26 wind farm survey years, because some wind farms supplied fatality monitoring data in >1 year, to estimate mortality. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry estimator (OMNRF) tended to be highest, while the Huso, Schoenfeld-Erickson, and GenEst estimators produced similar results. Huso and Schoenfeld-Erickson estimates tended to fall within 95% confidence intervals for GenEst, while OMNRF estimates tended to be higher than the upper confidence interval for GenEst. The results from the OMNRF estimator were consistent with the other candidates when carcass persistence times were >6.5 days but inconsistent when carcass persistence times were shorter. Our results demonstrated the degree to which mortality estimates can vary among estimators and highlight the need for a consistent estimator in comparative studies. We recommend GenEst for such studies, as this estimator can incorporate more inputs with flexibility to reflect site-specific field conditions and produces highly consistent results. Conversely, the OMNRF estimator produced consistently higher estimates than the other candidate estimators, and assumptions related to carcass persistence were regularly violated. We recommend that these limitations be acknowledged when interpreting results from this estimator and that its use be reconsidered when assumptions related to carcass persistence are not met.",research,Canada,35,0,0,0,0,HUM-WILDL INTERACT,Hum.-Wildl.

In long-lived animals with extended parental care, as in bats, migration tends to be socially transmitted rather than endogenous. For a young bat to learn migration via social transmission, they would need to follow an experienced individual, most likely one roosting nearby. Therefore, we predicted that bats travelling together originate from the same place. It is also likely that young bats would follow their mothers or other kin, so we predicted that bats travelling together are more closely related to each other than bats not travelling together. To test our predictions, we used microsatellite genotypes and stable isotope values of delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta H-2 to analyse the relatedness and geographical origins of migrating hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus/Aeorestes cinereus (Baird et al. 2015 J.

Contrary to our predictions, there was no evidence that related dyads of hoary bats or silver-haired bats were killed on the same night more frequently than expected by chance, or that the number of days between the fatalities of dyadmembers was influenced by relatedness or latitude of origin.

However, bats submitted for rabies testing typically have been those that have come in contact with humans or pets. Given the roosting ecology of L. cinereus and L. noctivagans, contact with healthy individuals of these species is expected to be rare, with a bias in contact and submission of infected individuals and thus an overestimation of rabies prevalence. We tested 121 L. cinereus and 96 L. noctivagans specimens, collected during mortality surveys at wind energy facilities in Southern Alberta, Canada in 2007 and 2008, for rabies. None of the L. cinereus (0%) and one L. noctivagans (1%) tested positive for rabies. Prevalence of rabies was significantly lower than previously reported estimates, passive and active, for L. cinereus and L. noctivagans. In a review of the literature including multiple bat species, we found a significant difference in estimates of rabies prevalence based on passive versus active surveillance testing. Furthermore, roosting ecology influenced estimates of rabies prevalence, with significantly higher prevalence among passive surveillance submissions of nonsynanthropic species compared to synanthropic species, a trend not evident in active surveillance reports. We conclude that rabies prevalence in randomly collected L. cinereus and L. noctivagans is low and comparable to active surveillance estimates from other species (<= 1%), and that roosting ecology influences estimates of rabies prevalence among bats submitted to public health laboratories in North America.",research,Canada,127,20,22,0,22,J WILDLIFE DIS,J.

Wind proponents attempt to mitigate these effects via operational curtailment, such that wind energy is not produced on nights with low wind speeds during the late summer and fall. Our study modeled bat activity and mortality on two timescales (nightly and seasonally) and in response to a range of weather variables. We showed that bat mortality risks could be lowered and opportunities for wind energy production can be increased by focusing curtailment efforts to the periods of the night and year when bats are most active and by considering a wider range of weather variables, compared to standard curtailment strategies. Relatively high mortality of migratory bats at wind energy facilities has prompted research to understand the underlying spatial and temporal factors, with the goal of developing more effective mitigation approaches. We examined acoustic recordings of echolocation calls at 12 sites and post-construction carcass survey data collected at 10 wind energy facilities in Ontario, Canada, to quantify the degree to which timing and regional-scale weather predict bat activity and mortality. Rain and low temperatures consistently predicted low mortality and activity of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and three species of migratory tree bats: hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), eastern red bat (L. borealis), and silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans). Bat activity occurred in waves with distinct peaks through the season; regardless of seasonal timing, most activities occurred in the first half of the night. We conclude that wind energy facilities could adopt a novel and more effective curtailment strategy based on weather and seasonal and nocturnal timing that would minimize mortality risks for bats while increasing the opportunities for power generation, relative to the mitigation strategy of increasing cut-in wind speed to 5.5 m/s.",research,Canada,48,3,3,1,14,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,DEC,2021,11,12,10.3390/ani11123503,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11123503,,,12,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology

We estimated collision mortality using data from carcass searches for 43 wind farms, incorporating correction factors for scavenger removal, searcher efficiency, and carcasses that fell beyond the area searched. On average, 8.2 +/- 1.4 birds (95% C.I.) were killed per turbine per year at these sites, although the numbers at individual wind farms varied from 0 - 26.9 birds per turbine per year. Based on 2955 installed turbines (the number installed in Canada by December 2011), an estimated 23,300 birds (95% C.I. 20,000 - 28,300) would be killed from collisions with turbines each year. We estimated direct habitat loss based on data from 32 wind farms in Canada. On average, total habitat loss per turbine was 1.23 ha, which corresponds to an estimated total habitat loss due to wind farms nationwide of 3635 ha. Based on published estimates of nest density, this could represent habitat for similar to 5700 nests of all species. Assuming nearby habitats are saturated, and 2 adults displaced per nest site, effects of direct habitat loss are less than that of direct mortality. Installed wind capacity is growing rapidly, and is predicted to increase more than 10-fold over the next 10-15 years, which could lead to direct mortality of approximately 233,000 birds / year, and displacement of 57,000 pairs. Despite concerns about the impacts of biased correction factors on the accuracy of mortality estimates, these values are likely much lower than those from collisions with some other anthropogenic sources such as windows, vehicles, or towers, or habitat loss due to many other forms of development. Species composition data suggest that < 0.2% of the population of any species is currently affected by mortality or displacement from wind turbine development.

We used monitoring surveys from the majority of facilities in a contiguous region spanning 800 km of southwest-northeast distance and almost 900 m of elevation (Quebec, Canada) to produce estimates of mortality per facility. The distribution of these estimated mortalities is skewed low with more than two thirds of facilities having annual mortalities of less than 50 individuals. We then used this set of estimated annual mortalities to explore how changes in installed capacity (megawatts), elevation and geographic position affected estimated annual mortality, with the goal of providing guidance to conservation mangers attempting to find strategies for minimizing mortality. More installed capacity (MW) correlated with higher mortality, but installed capacity alone was a poor predictor of estimated mortality. Medium-sized facilities were the best management strategy to minimize per MW mortality. Mortality decreased with increasing elevation and decreased from southwest to northeast within this region. The cumulative effects of this mortality have the potential to be devastating for bats, particularly migratory species, which account for the majority of carcasses observed.

However, searcher efficiency and level of survey effort among sites are variable. We evaluated how searcher efficiency and proportion of area surveyed affected precision of fatality estimates and probability of detecting rare fatalities (e.g., fatalities of an endangered species). We measured searcher-efficiency rates of human and dog-handler teams for 3 fatality types: feather spots, small carcasses, and large carcasses. We also created high and low searcher-efficiency scenarios to evaluate effects of searcher efficiency across a broader range. Model selection on a set of logistic regression models for our empirical trials supported search team and fatality type as important predictors of searcher-efficiency rates, and demonstrated that dog-handler teams had higher searcher efficiency for all fatality types than human search teams. We used model simulations to evaluate fatality estimates obtained across the 4 searche-refficiency scenarios and 10 levels of survey coverage: 10-100%, in increments of 10%. At each level of survey coverage, width of confidence intervals decreased as searcher efficiency increased; however, as survey coverage increased, width of the confidence intervals stabilized, and further increases in coverage did not lead to increases in precision. Average fatality estimates were biased positively and this bias increased with lesser searcher efficiency. The survey coverage necessary to achieve 80% detection probability for rare fatalities (defined as 1, 5, or 15 fatalities) decreased as searcher efficiency increased for all fatality types. When a rare fatality was defined as a single fatality out of 1,000, an 80% detection probability was achieved only by dog-handler teams and the high searcher-efficiency scenario, and only for large carcasses. Our results emphasize the need for managers and agencies to consider study objectives and site characteristics when selecting level of survey coverage, type of search team, and other options to maximize searcher efficiency.

Here, study on mortality of iconic bird and bat species were conducted on Adama I and II wind farms during wet (August 2018) and dry (March 2019) seasons. Materials and methods: The methodology employed carcass searches using direct physical inspections, semi -structured interviews ( n = 50), and focus group discussions of wind farm officials and farmers around Adama I and II wind farms. Descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentages, and chi-square test were employed to analyze the surveyed data. Result: The result suggested 51 (78.43%) carcass of bird species comprising 11 families. Out of the 125 installed operational turbines, about 35 species of birds were found in 11 families; 27 unidentified molted carcasses of species of birds were significantly impacted with Adama I and II wind farms. In addition, 11 unidentified species of bat were observed as collision victims. Conclusion: Wind farm establishment and expansion in areas with concentrations of the sensitive species had been avoided.

The estimated number of bats killed per turbine annually was relatively low (0-3) on flat, open farmland away from the coast, higher (2-5) in more complex agricultural landscapes, and highest (5-20) at the coast and on forested hills and ridges. The species killed almost exclusively (98%) belonged to a group (Nyctalus, Pipistrellus, Vespertilio and Eptesicus spp.) adapted for open-air foraging. The bats were killed by the moving rotor blades as they hunted insects attracted to the turbines. This occurred independently of sex and age. Peak mortality varied considerably in frequency and timing among years, but the events usually (90%) occurred on nights with low wind speeds in late July to early October and to a lesser extent (10%) also in April-June. The mortality increased with turbine tower height and rotor diameter but was independent of the distance from the ground to the lowest rotor point. It was also independent of the size of the wind park (1-18 turbines).

In this perspective, there is a need for reliable estimates of fatalities at wind farms, where the heterogeneity of the basic information, used among environmental assessment studies, is unlikely to support an accurate universal estimation method. We tested the applicability of the Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) to estimate bat fatalities, based on multifactorial cause-effect relationships (by integrating multi-model inference statistical analysis and dynamic modelling) between mortality estimates, detected fatalities and the selected key-components of the reality, such as the real number of bat mortalities simulated, the rate of carcasses removal, the searcher efficiency, the monitoring periodicity and the number of turbines for different realistic scenarios associated with particular wind farm conditions. Although some existing mortality estimators are considered accurate, the choice of a given universal formula for all mortality assessments, based on deterministic parameters and assumptions, may originate unsuspected errors. Therefore, we propose a flexible dynamic modelling framework, the StDM estimator, where the obtained algorithms are adaptable to the universe of application intended. The StDM estimator takes into account random, non-constant and scenario dependent parameters, providing bias-corrected estimates. The StDM estimator was applied for the European wind farm context and validated in the most cases tested, through the confrontation with independent data. Overall, this approach is considered a valuable tool to improve the quality of mortality estimates at onshore wind facilities, within the local, environmental and methodological gradients (including the cases where no mortality is detected), namely in the scope of environmental impact assessments and general ecological monitoring programmes.

Bat assemblages may be negatively affected by wind farms due to the fatality of a significant number of individuals after colliding with the moving turbines or experiencing barotrauma. The implementation of wind farms should follow standard procedures to prevent such negative impacts: avoid, reduce and offset, in what is known as the mitigation hierarchy. According to this approach avoiding impacts is the priority, followed by the minimisation of the identified impacts, and finally, when residual negative impacts still remain, those must be offset or at least compensated. This paper presents a review on conservation measures for bats and presents some guidelines within the compensation scenario, focusing on negative impacts that remain after avoidance and minimisation measures. The conservation strategies presented aim at the improvement of the ecological conditions for the bat assemblage as a whole. While developed under the European context, the proposed measures are potentially applicable elsewhere, taking into consideration the specificity of each region in terms of bat assemblages present, landscape features and policy context regarding nature and biodiversity conservation and management.

However, wind turbines may affect use of the surrounding habitats by bats. Little is known about such impact, especially in the European boreal biogeographical region.

We simultaneously monitored bat acoustic activity at 84 sampling sites placed at 200 m intervals from 0 to 1.000 m (2 recorders per distance class), over four months and at seven Finnish wind farms located in forested habitats. Our results show higher presence and activity at 600 m and further from turbines for Eptesicus nilssonii, and higher presence at 800 m and further for Myotis spp. We also saw an increase in bat activity during midsummer, which may be due to increased use of forest canopy cover during the short nights at this time. These results indicate a potential loss in habitat quality around wind turbines, e.g., a greater number of open areas in forests unfavourable to certain bat species. This lower activity and presence could also be an indication for active avoidance of the wind turbines from the bats. Furthermore, these results are the first of their kind for Eptesicus nilssonii, and for the European boreal biogeographical region. They show undeniable impacts of wind power on bats in Finland, and enforce the requirement for better consideration of bats during the development of such projects in Finland.

In Northern Europe, migratory bat species are often detected along the coastline of the Baltic Sea particularly during migration seasons in the spring and autumn. In spite of regular monitoring of bat migration at coastal sites, the overall distribution of migratory bats in Northern Europe and variability between sites and seasons are still very poorly known. In this study we used automated bat detectors to compare the activity of migratory bat species between coastal and inland monitoring sites along the west coast of Finland (61.5-61.9 degrees N, 21.3-22.3 degrees E). Our main goal was to test whether the activity of migratory bat species is associated with the coastline or whether these species also occur inland. Of migratory bat species observations, 98.6% were covered by Pipistrellus nathusii, which was detected at all our monitoring sites. The activity of the species decreased rapidly, with increasing distance from the coastline towards inland, indicating a sharp activity gradient along the coastline of the Baltic Sea. Because the activity of P. nathusii occurred in migration season and no similar spatial pattern was detected among sedentary species, our results suggest that the aggregation of P. nathusii at the coastline is related to migration as such rather than regular foraging behavior of this species. Our study has direct implications to the wind power planning in Northern Europe. Based on our study we conclude that the impact of wind power on both migratory (namely P. nathusii) and sedentary bat species (namely Eptesicus nilssonii) should be taken into account in wind power planning and impact mitigation in Northern Europe, especially if new wind farms are located along the coastline of the Baltic Sea.

In many countries, pre-installation acoustic surveys are mandatory in order to assess the impacts of wind farm projects. In this purpose, the use of wind masts to estimate bat activity and hence predict collision risk is highly recommended by conservation committees worldwide. Yet, the degree to which collisions may be predicted from acoustic monitoring at wind masts has been strongly debated. To assess this relationship, microphone arrays were installed on 23 wind masts in order to record and locate bat activity on the vertical axis during 3260 nights. For each species, we also calculated a collision susceptibility index, based on fatality data gathered in the literature and corrected for species abundance. We demonstrate that the collision susceptibility index is correlated with the percentage of bat passes at blade height. The acoustic recordings allowed us to establish a reference for the ratios of flight activity above heights of 20-45 m high for more than 16 European bat species.

While multi-turbine facilities have small physical footprint, they are not free from negative impacts on wildlife. This is particularly true for bats, whose population viability can be threatened by wind turbines through mortality events due to collisions. Wind turbine curtailment (hereafter referred to as blanket curtailment) in non-winter periods at low wind speeds and mild temperatures (i.e. when bats are active and wind energy production is low) can reduce fa-talities, but show variable and incomplete effectiveness because other factors affect fatality risks including landscape features, rain, turbine functioning, and seasonality. The combined effects of these drivers, and their potential as criteria in algorithm-based curtailment, have so far received little attention. We compiled bat acoustic data recorded over four years at 34 wind turbine nacelles in France from post-construction regulatory studies, including 8619 entire nights (251 +/- 58 nights per wind turbine on average). We modelled nightly bat activity in relation to its multiple drivers for three bat guilds, and assessed whether curtailment based on algorithm would be more efficient to limit bat expo-sure than blanket curtailment based on various combinations of unique wind speed and temperature thresholds. We found that landscape features, weather conditions, seasonality, and turbine functioning determine bat activity at na-celles. Algorithm-based curtailment is more efficient than blanket curtailment, and has the potential to drastically re-duce bat exposure while sustaining the same energy production. Compared to blanket curtailment, the algorithm curtailment reduces average exposure by 20 to 29 % and 7 to 12 % for the high-risk guilds of long-and mid-range echolocators, and by 24 to 31 % for the low-risk guild of short-range echolocators. These findings call for the use of algorithm curtailment as both power production and biodiversity benefits will be higher in most situations.",research,France,70,1,1,7,9,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

Evidence of wind turbine attraction and repulsion on bats, and underlying collision risks and habitats losses, are increasingly reported. Since bat activity strongly decreases with distance to optimal habitats such as woody edges, we hypothesize that the distance to these habitats could drive attraction and repulsion in the immediate vicinity of wind turbine. Although several studies have demonstrated wind turbine attraction and repulsion on bats separately, none have so far investigated the co-existence of both in the same landscape context and evaluated the underlying safe siting distance of wind turbines to bat habitats. We assessed how wind turbines alter bat activity in their immediate vicinity when located at different distances from hedgerows. We acoustically quantified bat activity for two guilds (short-and long-range echolocators) and two species/species group (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus kuhlii/nathusii from the mid-range echolocators guild) in open areas from 10 to 283 m from hedgerows using a paired sampling design (i.e. recordings conducted simultaneously in areas with and without wind turbines). Sixty-five pairs were sampled over 23 nights during the migration period (i.e. from late summer to late fall) in France. Overall, in the absence of wind turbine, we found that bat activity decreased with increasing distance to hedgerows for all guilds, as widely reported in the literature. Yet, this pattern was no longer observed under wind turbine. When looking at specific distances to hedgerows, we found the activity of all bat groups and species (except for Pipistrellus kuhlii/nathusii) near hedgerows (10-43 m) to be drastically lower under wind turbines than without wind turbine. In contrast, the activity of short-range echolocators was higher under wind turbines when located at 43-100 m from hedgerows, and it tended to be higher for long-range echolocators. Lastly, no effect was detected under wind turbines located at 100-283 m from hedgerows for any guild. Synthesis and applications. This study provides empirical evidence that wind turbines close to optimal habitats such as hedgerows strongly repel bats, while wind turbines located farther away in open areas could attract them. Increased risks of collisions and habitat losses near edges strengthen the importance of keeping wind turbines at a sufficient distance from woody edges (e.g. 200 m as recommended by EUROBATS guidelines).",research,France,51,4,4,4,12,J APPL ECOL,J.

Such impacts could durably affect populations, creating a need for improvement of knowledge to integrate this concern in implementation strategies. We quantified the impact of wind turbines at different distances on the activity of 11 bat taxa and 2 guilds. We compared bat activity at hedgerows (207 sites) located at a distance of 0-1000 m from wind turbines (n = 151) of 29 wind farms in an agricultural region in the autumn (overall 193,980 bat passes) using GLMMs. We found a significant negative effect of proximity to turbines on activity for 3 species (Barbastella barbastzllus, Nyctalus leisleiri, Pipistrellus pipistrellus), 2 species-groups (Myotis spp., Plecotus spp.) and 2 guilds (fast-flying and gleaner). Bat activity within 1000 m of wind turbines by gleaners and fast-flying bats is reduced by 53.8% and 19.6%, respectively.

We used data from the French bat monitoring program based on citizen science and standardised acoustic recordings (4409 sites monitored and 9807 nights monitored from 2014 to 2020) to characterise the diel activity patterns of 20 bat species so that their consideration in mitigation measures can help conservation.

We found that bat species could be separated in three functional groups characterised by a crepuscular activity, an activity that occurs when it is completely dark or an intermediate activity.

Previous studies tried to assess the effects of landscape on mortalities. Yet, the count of carcasses found per species is low, leading to a low statistical power. Acoustic surveys collect large datasets (proxy for bat density); however, if bat vertical distribution is not accounted for, a key mechanism in collisions is missed. Objectives Our goal was to disentangle the effects of landscape on bat density and vertical distribution to produce recommendations for wind farm siting. Methods With a vertical array of two microphones, we monitored the acoustic activity and located the vertical distribution of more than 16 bat species on 48 wind masts in France and Belgium (> 8000 nights). We modelled bat density and vertical distribution for six species in function of distance to water, woodland and buildings, and in function of the topography at three different scales (200 m, 1000 m and 5000 m). Results The proportion of flights at heights with collision risk was maximum in spring and autumn and minimum in summer for three species. This effect was often antagonistic to the effect of bat density. The landscape had a stronger effect on bat density than on bat vertical distribution. Conclusions Positioning wind farms away from woodland should reduce the density and therefore the collision risks of low-flying species but should be inefficient for high-flying species.

In this study, we compared characteristics of Nathusius' pipistrelles (Pipistrellus nathusii) killed at wind turbines (N = 119) to those observed within the live population (N = 524) during the summer migration period in Germany. We used generalized linear mixed-effects modeling to identify demographic groups most vulnerable to wind turbine mortality, including sex (female or male), age (adult or juvenile), and geographic origin (regional or long-distance migrant; depicted by fur stable hydrogen isotope ratios). Juveniles contributed with a higher proportion of carcasses at wind turbines than expected given their frequency in the live population suggesting that juvenile bats may be particularly vulnerable to wind turbine mortality. This effect varied with wind turbine density. Specifically, at low wind turbine densities, representing mostly inland areas with water bodies and forests where Nathusius' pipistrelles breed, juveniles were found more often dead beneath turbines than expected based on their abundance in the live population. At high wind turbine densities, representing mostly coastal areas where Nathusius' pipistrelles migrate, adults and juveniles were equally vulnerable. We found no evidence of increased vulnerability to wind turbines in either sex, yet we observed a higher proportion of females than males among both carcasses and the live population, which may reflect a female bias in the live population most likely caused by females migrating from their northeastern breeding areas migrating into Germany. A high mortality of females is conservation concern for this migratory bat species because it affects the annual reproduction rate of populations. A distant origin did not influence the likelihood of getting killed at wind turbines. A disproportionately high vulnerability of juveniles to wind turbine mortality may reduce juvenile recruitment, which may limit the resilience of Nathusius' pipistrelles to environmental stressors such as climate change or habitat loss. Schemes to mitigate wind turbine mortality, such as elevated cut-in speeds, should be implemented throughout Europe to prevent population declines of Nathusius' pipistrelles and other migratory bats.",research,Germany,59,5,5,3,16,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Yet, the impact on biodiversity is barely understood. Bats may be heavily affected by wind turbines in forests, because many species depend on forest ecosystems for roosting and hunting and can experience high fatality rates at wind turbines. We performed acoustic surveys in 24 temperate forests in the low mountain ranges of Central Germany to monitor changes in the acoustic activity of bats in relation to wind turbine proximity, rotor size, vegetation structure and season. Call sequences were identified and assigned to one of three functional guilds: open-space, edge-space and narrow-space foragers, the latter being mainly forest specialists. Based on the response behaviour of bats towards wind turbines in open landscapes, we predicted decreasing bat activity towards wind turbines at forest sites, especially for narrow-space foragers. Vertical vegetation heterogeneity had a strong positive effect on all bats, yet responses to wind turbines in forests varied across foraging guilds. Activity of narrow-space foragers decreased towards turbines over distances of several hundred metres, especially towards turbines with large rotors and during mid-summer months. The activity of edge-space foragers did not change with distance to turbines or season, whereas the activity of open-space foragers increased close to turbines in late summer. Synthesis and applications. Forest specialist bats avoid wind turbines in forests over distances of several hundred metres. This avoidance was most apparent towards turbines with large rotors. Since forests are an important habitat for these bats, we advise to exclude forests with diverse vegetation structure as potential wind turbine sites and to consider compensation measures to account for habitat degradation associated with the operation of wind turbines in forests.",research,Germany,70,5,5,7,19,J APPL ECOL,J.

Based on data from the national carcass repository in Germany and from our own carcass searches at a wind park with three turbines west of Berlin, we evaluated the magnitude of bat casualties at old, potentially poor-sited wind turbines operating without curtailment. We report 88 documented bat carcasses collected by various searchers over the 20-year operation period of this wind park from 2001 to 2021. Common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) and common pipistrelles (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) were most often found dead at these turbines. Our search campaign in August and September 2021 yielded a total of 18 carcasses. We estimated that at least 209 bats were likely killed during our field survey, yielding more than 70 casualties/wind turbine or 39 casualties/ MW in two months. Since our campaign covered only part of the migration season, we consider this value as an underestimate. The 20-year period of the wind park emphasises the substantial impact old turbines may have on bat individuals and populations when operating without curtailments.

At the same time, concerns about the number of birds and bats being killed at wind turbines have been growing. In this situation, methods for a reliable estimation of bird and bat fatality numbers are needed. To obtain an unbiased estimate of the number of fatalities from fatality searches, the probability to detect the carcass of an animal being killed at a turbine has to be assessed by considering carcass persistence rate, searcher efficiency and the probability that a killed animal falls into a searched area. Here, we describe a new formula to determine the detection probability of birds or bats that are killed at wind turbines and which can estimate the number of fatalities from the number of carcasses found. The formula was developed to analyse a large data set of bats killed at wind turbines in Germany. In simulations, we compared it to three other formulas used in this context. Our new formula seems to have unbiased results when searcher efficiency and carcass removal rate are constant over time. When searcher efficiency or carcass removal rate varied with time, all four formulas showed a similar bias.

Even though avoidance and mitigation measures could benefit from a better knowledge of the species' migratory habits, we lack basic information about what habitats and corridors bats use during migration. We studied the isotopic niche dimensions of three bat species that are frequently killed at wind turbines in Germany: non-migratory Pipistrellus pipistrellus, mid-distance migratory Nyctalus noctula, and long-distance migratory Pipistrellus nathusii. We measured stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (delta C-13, delta N-15) in five tissues that differed in isotopic retention time (fur, wing membrane tissue, muscle, liver, blood) to shed light on the species-specific habitat use during the autumn migration period using standard ellipse areas (SEA(c)). Further, we used stable isotope ratios of non-exchangeable hydrogen (delta H-2(K)) in fur keratin to assess the breeding origin of bats. We inferred from isotopic composition (delta C-13, delta N-15) of fur keratin that isotopic niche dimensions of P. nathusii was distinct from that of N. noctula and P. pipistrellus, probably because P. nathusii was using more aquatic habitats than the other two species. Isoscape origin models supported that traveled distances before dying at wind turbines was largest for P. nathusii, intermediate for N. noctula, and shortest for P. pipistrellus. Isotopic niche dimensions calculated for each sample type separately reflected the species' migratory behavior. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and N. noctula showed similar isotopic niche breadth across all tissue types, whereas SEA(c) values of P. nathusii increased in tissues with slow turnaround time.

To formulate mitigation measures such as curtailment, recent approaches relate the acoustic activity of bats around reference turbines to casualties to extrapolate fatality rates at turbines where only acoustic surveys are conducted. Here, we modeled how sensitive this approach is when spatial distributions of bats vary within the rotor-swept zone, and when the coverage of acoustic monitoring deteriorates, for example, with increasing turbine size. The predictive power of acoustic surveys was high for uniform or random distributions of bats. A concentration of bat passes around the nacelle or at the lower portion of the risk zone caused an overestimation of bat activity when ultrasonic microphones were pointed downwards at the nacelle. Conversely, a concentration of bat passes at the edge or at the top portion of the risk zone caused an underestimation of bat activity. These effects increased as the coverage of the acoustic monitoring decreased. Extrapolated fatality rates may not necessarily match with real conditions without knowledge of the spatial distribution of bats, particularly when the risk zone is poorly covered by acoustic monitoring, when spatial distributions are skewed and when turbines are large or frequencies of echolocating bats high.

Using miniaturized GPS loggers, we studied how an open-space foraging bat with high collision risk with wind turbines, the common noctule Nyctalus noctula (Schreber, 1774), interacts with wind turbines. We compared actual flight trajectories to correlated random walks to identify habitat variables explaining the movements of bats. Both sexes preferred wetlands but used conventionally managed cropland less than expected based on availability. During midsummer, females traversed the land on relatively long flight paths and repeatedly came close to wind turbines. Their flight heights above ground suggested a high risk of colliding with wind turbines. In contrast, males recorded in early summer commuted straight between roosts and foraging areas and overall flew lower than the operating range of most turbine blades, suggesting a lower collision risk. Flight heights of bats suggest that during summer the risk of collision with wind turbines was high for most studied bats at the majority of currently installed wind turbines.

During environmental impact assessments, consultant ecologists often use automated ultrasonic detectors (AUDs) to estimate the activity and identity of bats in the zone of highest mortality risk at WTs in order to formulate mitigation schemes, such as increased curtailment speeds to prevent casualties. While acknowledging the potential of acoustic monitoring, we evaluate the limitations of AUDs for monitoring bats at WTs and highlight directions for future research. We show that geometric attenuation and atmospheric attenuation of ultrasonic echolocation calls, in conjunction with limited sensitivity of ultrasonic microphones, severely constrain detection distances of bats at WTs. Taking into account the acoustic shadow produced by the nacelle, AUDs cover only approximately 23% of the risk zone for a bat calling at 20 kHz and 4% for a bat calling at 40 kHz, assuming a 60 m blade length. This percentage will further decrease with increasing blade lengths in modern WTs. Additionally, the directionality of echolocation calls and the dynamic flight behaviour of bats constrain the detectability of bats. If a call can be detected, the low interspecific and high intraspecific variation of echolocation call characteristics may impair species identification, limiting the power to predict population-level effects of fatalities. We conclude that technical, physical, and biological factors severely constrain acoustic monitoring in its current form. We suggest the use of several AUDs, installed at complementary sites at WTs, and the testing of other techniques, such as radar, cameras, and thermal imaging, to inform stakeholders on the mortality risk of bats at WTs.",research,Germany,60,18,18,5,23,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,OCT,2021,51,4,10.1111/mam.12248,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.12248,,21-Mar,12,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology

In contrast, mono-specific forest plantations are considered ecologically less valuable; thus, decision-makers recommend these plantations as suitable locations for wind power stations and therefore want to further expand wind turbines in these habitats. This is expected to have a strong negative impact on the landscape because forests would be cleared for wind turbine pads and access roads and wind turbines rise above the trees with adverse impacts for bats. Therefore, we argue that, in light of bat conservation, the suitability of forest plantations for wind energy development is not, per se, warranted and that implications of wind power stations, even in mono-specific forest plantations, should be assessed and evaluated. We conducted long-term bat activity monitoring and recorded bat echolocation calls above the canopies of different forest sites (coniferous monoculture plantations and semi-natural mixed deciduous forests) in Germany and compared different forest types in terms of species richness, total bat activity, activity of the three bat species groups and species composition. Generalised linear models revealed that forest type and the amount of forest biotopes did not enhance bat activity. Ordination showed that species composition was not affected by forest type, location and connectivity. Mono-specific forest plantations can harbour a diverse bat fauna with high species activity and are, therefore, valuable bat habitats just as near-natural or semi-natural woodlands are. Environmental impact assessment and mitigation measures are vital in all forest types before and after planning for wind energy turbines.

As a result, wind energy facilities are increasingly being installed in forests,2,3 despite the fact that forests are crucial for the protection of terrestrial biodiversity.4 This green-green dilemma is particularly evident for bats, as most species at risk of colliding with wind turbines roost in trees.2 With some of these species re-ported to be declining,5-8 we see an urgent need to understand how bats respond to wind turbines in forested areas, especially in Europe where all bat species are legally protected. We used miniaturized global posi-tioning system (GPS) units to study how European common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula), a species that is highly vulnerable at turbines,9 respond to wind turbines in forests. Data from 60 tagged common noctules yielded a total of 8,129 positions, of which 2.3% were recorded at distances <100 m from the nearest turbine. Bats were particularly active at turbines <500 m near roosts, which may require such turbines to be shut down more frequently at times of high bat activity to reduce collision risk. Beyond roosts, bats avoided turbines over several kilometers, supporting earlier findings on habitat loss for forest-associated bats.10 This habitat loss should be compensated by developing parts of the forest as refugia for bats.

Noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) and Leisler's bats (Nyctalus leisleri) were of Scandinavian or northeastern origin.

Two approaches have been employed to assess collision rates: carcass searches and surveys of animals prone to collisions. Carcass searches can provide an estimate for the actual number of animals being killed but they offer little information on the relation between collision rates and, for example, weather parameters due to the time of death not being precisely known. In contrast, a density index of animals exposed to collision is sufficient to analyse the parameters influencing the collision rate. However, quantification of the collision rate from animal density indices (e.g. acoustic bat activity or bird migration traffic rates) remains difficult. We combine carcass search data with animal density indices in a mixture model to investigate collision rates. In a simulation study we show that the collision rates estimated by our model were at least as precise as conventional estimates based solely on carcass search data. Furthermore, if certain conditions are met, the model can be used to predict the collision rate from density indices alone, without data from carcass searches. This can reduce the time and effort required to estimate collision rates. We applied the model to bat carcass search data obtained at 30 wind turbines in 15 wind facilities in Germany. We used acoustic bat activity and wind speed as predictors for the collision rate. The model estimates correlated well with conventional estimators. Our model can be used to predict the average collision rate. It enables an analysis of the effect of parameters such as rotor diameter or turbine type on the collision rate. The model can also be used in turbine-specific curtailment algorithms that predict the collision rate and reduce this rate with a minimal loss of energy production.",research,Germany,50,44,45,5,159,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,3-Jul,2013,8,7,10.1371/journal.pone.0067997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067997,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Exact knowledge on animals' habitat use, however, is key to effective landscape planning to avoid human-wildlife-conflicts, such as the construction of wind turbines in areas with high bat activity that may result in bat fatalities. We measured bat activity in relation to distance to hedgerows in an agricultural landscape in northeastern Germany. We recorded bat echolocation calls at ground level at 0, 50, 100 and 200 m distances from hedges at five sites during three nights in spring (April to June) and three nights in summer (July to October) at each site. For all bat species we found the overall activity to be similar between seasons, with the highest activity near the hedges, but with considerable variation in species-specific spatial activity patterns between spring and summer. While the genus Myotis and Pipistrellus pipistrellus were mostly active close to the hedges at a similar intensity over the entire study period (i.e. 84% and 86% of all bat passes, respectively), Nyctalus noctula and Pipistrellus nathusii showed generally less pronounced concentration of activity near the hedges, and increased activity away from the hedges in summer. Similarly, Pipistrellus pygmaeus showed decreased activity away from the hedges during both seasons, but with reduced activity near the hedges in summer. The observed behavioural changes in activity in relation to distance to hedgerows are likely due to migration or the bats foraging for different prey between seasons.

We conducted an operational experiment by sequentially placing a mobile SWT with five different operational modes at six sites of high bat activity, including roosts, commuting structures, and highly frequented hunting areas. Bat flight trajectories around the SWT were documented at each site during five consecutive nights using a specifically designed high-spatial-resolution 3D camera. The recordings showed high bat activity levels close to the SWT (7,065 flight trajectories within a 10-m radius). The minimum distance to the rotor of each trajectory varied between 0 and 18 m, with a mean of 4.6 m across all sites. Linear mixed models created to account for site differences showed that, compared to a reference pole without a SWT, bats flew 0.4 m closer to the rotor (95% CI 0.3-0.6 m) if it was out of operation and 0.3 m closer (95% CI 0.1-0.4 m) if it was moving slowly. Exploratory behavior was frequently observed, with many bats deviating from their original flight trajectory to approach the rotor. Among 7,850 documented trajectories, 176 crossed the rotor, including 65 while it was in motion. The collision of one P. pygmaeus individual occurred during the experiment. These results demonstrate that, despite the generally strong ability of bats to evade moving rotor blades, bat casualties at SWTs placed at sites of high bat activity can reach or exceed the current threshold levels set for large wind turbines. As SWTs provide less energy than large turbines, their negative impact on bats should be minimized by avoidance measures such as a bat-friendly site selection or curtailment algorithms.",research,Germany,29,1,1,3,15,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,25-Jun,2021,16,6,10.1371/journal.pone.0253782,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253782,,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Presumably, more than 250,000 bats are killed annually due to interactions with German wind turbines, and total losses may account for more than two million killed bats over the past 10 years, if mitigation measures were not practiced. More than 70% of killed bats are migrants, because major migratory routes cross Germany. Consequently, Germany's environmental policy is key to the conservation of migratory bats in Europe. Prospective increases in wind power will lead to the installation of larger wind turbines with potentially devastating consequences for bats. The higher net energy production of modern wind turbines at low wind speeds may exacerbate the conflict between green energy and conservation goals since revenue losses for companies increase.

Current observations suggest that mostly hill-topping, swarming, and migrating insects interact with wind turbines. Recently, the annual loss of insect biomass at wind turbines was estimated for Germany to amount 1,200 t for the plant growth period, which equates to about 1.2 trillion killed insects per year, assuming 1 mg insect body mass. Accordingly, a single turbine located in the temperate zone might kill about 40 million insects per year. Furthermore, Scheimpflug Lidar measurements at operating wind turbines confirm a high insect activity in the risk zone of turbines. These numbers and observations are alarming, yet they require further consolidation, particularly across all continents and climate zones where wind energy industry is expanding. We need to understand (a) how attraction of insects to wind turbines affect fatality rates and interactions of insect predators with wind turbines.

To better assess likely populations effects of wind turbine related wildlife fatalities, we studied the geographical origin of the most common bat species found dead below German wind turbines, the noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula). We measured stable isotope ratios of non-exchangeable hydrogen in fur keratin to separate migrants from local individuals, used a linear mixed-effects model to identify temporal, spatial and biological factors explaining the variance in measured stable isotope ratios and determined the geographical breeding provenance of killed migrants using isoscape origin models. We found that 72% of noctule bat casualties (n = 136) were of local origin, while 28% were long-distance migrants. These findings highlight that bat fatalities at German wind turbines may affect both local and distant populations. Our results indicated a sex and age-specific vulnerability of bats towards lethal accidents at turbines, i.e. a relatively high proportion of killed females were recorded among migratory individuals, whereas more juveniles than adults were recorded among killed bats of local origin. Migratory noctule bats were found to originate from distant populations in the Northeastern parts of Europe. The large catchment areas of German wind turbines and high vulnerability of female and juvenile noctule bats call for immediate action to reduce the negative cross-boundary effects of bat fatalities at wind turbines on local and distant populations. Further, our study highlights the importance of implementing effective mitigation measures and developing species and scale-specific conservation approaches on both national and international levels to protect source populations of bats.

Concern about bat activity above the canopy has now been raised owing to rapidly increasing demands for wind energy and the ensuing placement of wind turbines over forests. We investigated the little-explored vertical stratification of bat activity in forests at ten sites on ten nights using five simultaneous bat-call recorders placed from near ground up to above the canopy. The vegetation-free space at each recorder position was measured with terrestrial laser scanning. We predicted that (1) the activity of Pipistrellus, nyctaloids and the open-habitat foraging guild will increase in mature forests with increasing height above ground, independent of local vegetation density and temperature, and (2) the activity of Myotis and the edge-habitat-foraging guild will decrease with height but increase with local low vegetation density. Our generalized linear mixed model indicated that nyctaloids, Pipistrellus and open-habitat foragers were increasingly active in higher strata, independent of temperature and local vegetation density. Activity of Myotis and Pipistrellus species and the edge-habitat foragers was higher along interior edges of forests. The activity of single species in the above-canopy stratum could be explained well by their Europe-wide wind-turbine risk assessment. Thus, we conclude that open-habitat bat species and Pipistrellus species not only forage regularly in clearings or forest meadows, but also above the canopy of closed mature stands, behaviour that may put them at risk from turbines.

Therefore, we investigated the influence of small isolated ponds which lie within arable fields close to vegetation structures on the flight and foraging activity of bats. Additionally, we compared species-specific activity measures between forest edges and linear structures such as hedgerows. We repeatedly recorded bat activity using passive acoustic monitoring along 20 transects extending from the vegetation edge up to 200 m into the arable field (hereafter: edge-field interface) with a small pond present at five transects per edge type (linear vs. forest). Using generalized linear mixed effect models, we analyzed the effects of edge type, pond presence and the season on species-specific flight and foraging activity within the edge-field interface. We found a higher flight activity of Nyctalus noctula and Pipistrellus pygmaeus above the arable field when a pond was present. Furthermore, Pipistrellus nathusii and Pipistrellus pipistrellus foraged more frequently at forest edges than at linear structures (e.g. hedgerows). Additionally, we found three major patterns of seasonal variation in the activity of bats along the edge-field interface. This study highlights the species-specific and dynamic use of forest and hedgerow or tree line edges by bats and their importance for different bat species in the agricultural landscape. Further, additional landscape elements such as small isolated ponds within arable fields might support the activity of bats above the open agricultural landscape, thereby facilitating agroecosystem functioning. Therefore, additional landscape elements within managed areas should be restored and protected against the conversion into arable land and better linked to surrounding landscape elements in order to efficiently support bats within the agroecosystem.

At two study sites we analysed temporally linked consecutive echolocation recordings between neighbouring automated acoustic devices (batcorder) which were installed at 3.5 m (ground), 20 m (canopy), 35 m (above the canopy) and at 50 and 80 m (open airspace). We assigned 7-10% of all contacts to vertical movements. Bats moved along the lattice towers at heights of between 3.5 and 20 m at both sites and between 20 and 35 m at one site. Although the extent of this explorative behaviour may have been underestimated due to limited acoustic detection distance, and although we used a lattice tower (most wind turbine monopoles are made of a different material), the almost complete lack of echolocation calls above 50 m at the first study site and above 20 m at the second study site makes it unlikely that explorative behaviour may expose B. barbastellus to significant risk.",research,Germany,41,4,4,0,5,HYSTRIX,Hystrix,,2017,28,2,10.4404/hystrix-00009-2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.4404/hystrix-00009-2017,,,5,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology

Although wind energy production is to some desirable as a form of renewable energy for reducing global CO2 emission, it conflicts with conservation goals when airborne animals die during collisions. Yet, protecting species with high collision risk may prevent to some extent the deployment of wind turbines or involve altered operation schemes with lowered energy production, two constraints impairing the development of wind energy production. Stakeholders involved in wind turbine projects discuss this dilemma not only based on their knowledge and interests, but also on their thoughts and emotions about wind turbines or affected animals such as bats. We studied some of these cognitions and emotions of stakeholders involved in the local realization of wind turbine projects (e.g. planning or authorization) to shed light on fundamental aspects of disagreements. We undertook a self-administered online survey (n=537 respondents) with six stakeholder groups from the wind energy and conservation sector to understand i) their value orientations, beliefs and emotions, the predictive potential of ii) value orientations, beliefs, emotions on trust as well as iii) trust among and in stakeholders involved in decision making processes. We observed that beliefs about the importance of wind turbines and emotions towards wind turbines differed across stakeholders while emotions towards bats were generally positive. Overall, stakeholders had low trust in each other. Representatives from the wind energy sector had more trust in politicians compared to conservationists. Trust was most strongly influenced by beliefs about the importance of wind turbines. Beliefs about the importance of wind turbines were in turn most strongly influenced by emotions towards bats and wind turbines. We argue that awareness of different beliefs and emotions among stakeholders should be acknowledged in this apparent conflict to foster trust among stakeholders. (C) 2020 The Authors.

While migrating along the German coastline, Nathusius' pipistrelles (Pipistrellus nathusii) are regularly killed at wind turbines. Therefore, we explored the paths taken on their annual journey. Methods We used isotope ratio mass spectrometry to measure stable hydrogen and strontium isotope ratios in fur keratin of 59 Nathusius' pipistrelles captured on three offshore islands. Samples were pre-treated before analysis to report exclusively stable isotope ratios of non-exchangeable hydrogen. We generated maps to predict summer origins of bats using isoscape models. Results Bats were classified as long-distance migrants, mostly originating from Eastern Europe. Hydrogen analysis suggested for some bats a possible Fennoscandian origin, yet additional information from strontium analysis excluded this possibility. Instead, our data suggest that most Nathusius' pipistrelles migrating along the German coastline were of continental European summer origin, but also highlight the possibility that Nathusius' pipistrelles of Baltorussian origin may travel offshore from Fennoscandia to Germany. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the benefit of using complementary isotopic tracers for analysing the migratory pathways of bats and also potentially other terrestrial vertebrate species. Furthermore, data from our study suggest an offset of fur strontium isotope ratios in relation to local bedrock.",research,Germany,79,11,11,2,15,RAPID COMMUN MASS SP,Rapid Commun.

Most studies into the collision risk between species and wind turbines, however, have taken place in industrialized countries. Potential effects for many locations and species therefore remain unclear. To redress this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of recorded collisions between birds and bats and wind turbines within developed countries. We related collision rate to species-level traits and turbine characteristics to quantify the potential vulnerability of 9538 bird and 888 bat species globally. Avian collision rate was affected by migratory strategy, dispersal distance and habitat associations, and bat collision rates were influenced by dispersal distance. For birds and bats, larger turbine capacity (megawatts) increased collision rates; however, deploying a smaller number of large turbines with greater energy output reduced total collision risk per unit energy output, although bat mortality increased again with the largest turbines. Areas with high concentrations of vulnerable species were also identified, including migration corridors. Our results can therefore guide wind farm design and location to reduce the risk of large-scale animal mortality.

In general, these estimators account for: 1) partial coverage; 2) carcass removal (e.g. by scavengers or decay); and 3) imperfect detection. Perhaps surprisingly, a universal estimator that ensures good quality estimates under general circumstances is still lacking. Further, the existing estimators include different adjustment approaches and a variety of often implicit and misunderstood assumptions that may not be valid, making it difficult for practitioners to choose between them. Focusing on bird and bat fatality at onshore wind farms, we summarise and discuss implementation aspects and the assumptions involved in seven commonly used estimators.

At this stage, it is important to identify what we have learnt so far, as well as which predominant uncertainties and gaps remain. This review article aims to consolidate the state of knowledge, providing a qualitative analysis of the main effects of wind energy development on- and offshore, focusing on frequently studied species groups (bats, breeding and resting birds, raptors, migratory birds, marine mammals). We reviewed over 220 publications from which we identified predominant hypotheses that were summarized and displayed in tables. Journal publications, conference contributions, and further studies have been considered. We found that research focusing on offshore wind energy within the last couple of years has increased significantly as well, catching up with the vast amount of onshore studies. Some hypotheses have been verified by numerous publications and a consensus has been reached (e.g., correlation between bat activity and weather factors), while others are still being debated more (e.g., determination of migratory corridors) or remain unknown (e.g., effect on population level). Factors influencing potential effects were mainly related to species characteristics (morphology, phenology, abundance, behavior, and response to turbines) or site characteristics (landscape features, weather, and habitat quality).

The effects of WT features and environmental variables at different spatial scales associated to bat deaths in a mountainous and forested area in Thrace, NE Greece were investigated. Initially, we sought to quantify the most lethal WT characteristic between tower height, rotor diameter and power. The scale of interaction distance between bat deaths and the land cover characteristics surrounding the WTs was quantified. A statistical model was trained and validated against bat deaths and WT, land cover, and topography features. Variance partitioning between bat deaths and the explanatory covariates was conducted. The trained model was used to predict bat deaths attributed to existing and future wind farm development in the region. Results indicated that the optimal interaction distance between WT and surrounding land cover was 5 km, the larger distance than the ones examined. WT power, natural land cover type and distance from water explained 40 %, 15 % and 11 % respectively of the total variance in bat deaths by WTs. The model predicted that operating but not surveyed WTs comprise of 377.8 % and licensed but not operating yet will contribute to 210.2 % additional deaths than the ones recorded. Results indicate that among all WT features and land cover characteristics, wind turbine power is the most significant factor associated to bat deaths. In addition, WTs located within 5 km buffer comprised of natural land cover types have substantial higher deaths. More WT power will result in more deaths.

Here we provide evidence from a post-construction monitoring study conducted in north-eastern Greece between August 2009 and July 2010. Overall, 88 turbines from nine wind farms were intensively searched, and 181 dead and two injured bats were found in their proximity. The most frequently killed species were Nyctalus leisleri (n = 56), Pipistrellus pipistrellus/P. pygmaeus (53), P nathusii (35), Hypsugo savii (23) and N. noctula (10). Fatality rates were high from June to September. Most killed bats were adult males. Observed differences in the temporal pattern of fatalities among species may be associated with differences in their behaviour and distribution. Sex segregation with males at higher elevation, where the wind farms were located, and/or absence of females from such areas during summer may be the reason behind the higher male mortality rates. Bat fatalities were unequally distributed among wind farms and turbines. Four turbines (5%) accounted for 27% and 13 turbines (15%) for 51% of the fatalities. The most frequently killed species exhibited different spatial patterns of fatality, presumably because some turbines were located closer to roosts and/or commuting corridors. Fatalities were positively correlated with tower height but not with rotor size.

Horizontal-axis wind turbines, the main tool in this industry, induce mortality in flying animals and consequently bring about conservation concerns and regulatory restrictions. We utilized a unique combination of RADAR, LIDAR and ultrasonic acoustic recorders to test the utility of a novel technology meant to prevent wind turbine-related mortality in bats. Our drone-mounted deterrent device produces a pulsating combination of strong auditory and visual signals while moving through the air. LIDAR was used to assess the device's impact below its flight altitude and RADAR to assess its influence above its flight altitude. Continuous acoustic recordings from ground level to similar to 400 m above-ground-level were used to monitor bat activity in the research site. We recorded the nightly altitudinal distributions of multiple bat species throughout the experiment. Analysis revealed a significant change in activity while the deterrent was flying compared to baseline conditions. We also recorded a significant similar to 40% decrease below and a significant similar to 50% increase above the deterrent's flight altitude during its operation compared to the post-flight control. The tested technology is independent of wind farm activities and does not require modifying wind turbine form or operation procedures. The device differs from previously proposed solutions by being dynamic - moving in the airspace and emitting constantly changing signals - thus decreasing the probability of animal habituation. Our findings suggest that the deterrent could dramatically decrease wind turbine-related mortality by deterring bats from approaching rotor-swept airspace. Focused implementation in conditions where bat activity and energy production are in conflict may provide a practical, cost-effective mortality mitigation solution compared to current alternatives. Thus, our results should be considered by the wind-turbine industry and environmental monitoring and animal conservation organizations, as well as by regulatory agencies, when pursuing alleviation of wind turbine-related mortality.",intervention,Israel,76,0,0,9,19,REMOTE SENS ECOL CON,Remote Sens.

We used the SDM to create a map of connectivity using the software UNICOR to identify potential commuting corridors (PCCs). The incidence of each wind farm on bat flight corridors was assessed by overlaying the existing (380) and planned (195) turbine locations onto the PCCs. The SDM was statistically robust (AUC > 0.8). Most of the corridors were concentrated in the western part of the region, which hosts the largest suitable areas for the species; most of the existing (54 %) and planned (72 %) wind farms interfered with important corridors connecting the western and the eastern parts of the region. Our results provide key information on the impact of the wind farm industry on biodiversity on a regional scale. The novel approach adopted, based on SDM and connectivity analysis, could be easily extended to other flying vertebrates and landscapes and constitutes a promising planning tool necessary for harmonizing the development of renewable energy infrastructures with issues of biodiversity conservation.",research,Italy,76,46,47,7,147,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Detection of bird carcasses at wind turbines in the field is affected by carcass persistence and searcher detection rate. Integrated detection trials, which integrate carcass persistence and searcher detection trials into the periodic fatality search, have been proposed as an effective method for estimating these parameters. The purpose of our study was to test whether and how environmental factors affect integrated detection trial outcomes at multiple wind farms. We conducted this study at 10 wind farms in various environments of Japan. Binary data on trial outcomes in open versus forested areas served as our response variable in a generalized additive mixed model informed by days into trial, carcass body mass, season, whether snow covered the ground, and precipitation. For both ground cover types, days into trial and body mass were included in all the top models, suggesting that these factors most influenced bird carcass detection probability in integrated trials. The best model in open areas included days into trial, body mass, snow, and precipitation, and the best model in forested areas included days into trial, body mass, snow, precipitation, and season. Values of area under the curve indicated high accuracy of the best model for both ground cover types. The survey design needs to be appropriate to the size of the target species and to the environment in which the impacts will occur, such as the site's seasonality, its ground cover, and whether snow will cover the ground. Frequency of post-construction fatality monitoring should also be set cautiously, especially at wind farms located on small-bird migration routes, at wind farms in open areas, in areas with snow-covered ground in winter, or in forested areas during spring and summer because detection probabilities decline fastest under such conditions.",research,Japan,64,0,0,3,9,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

A comprehensive review of wind-wildlife fatality information is still lacking for Latin America; however, given the current installed capacity and the projected increase of wind energy production across Latin America, it is important to fill in the knowledge gap on impacts to wildlife. To provide a current summary of known impacts to birds and bats in Latin America and to identify gaps on this important information, we compiled, reviewed, and synthesized bird and bat fatality information at wind energy projects in the region. Our literature search resulted in 10 references relevant to the scope of this review, six of which provided number of fatalities by species and the type of PCFM search being conducted, meeting our criteria for inclusion in fatality summaries. From this pool, we found that Passerines composed the majority of bird fatalities, with no Threatened bird species reported. The bat family Molossidae composed the majority of bat fatalities, with one Threatened bat species reported. Our review of all studies and focused assessment of only those studies with fatality summaries indicated differences in the amount of information and level of detail related to bird and bat fatalities at wind energy projects in Latin America. Due to the taxon-specific nature of collision risk with wind turbines for birds and bats, it is difficult to make a general impact assessment of wind energy development on birds and bats in Latin America, especially given the limited information available.

Strictly nocturnal animals such as bats are particularly sensitive to artificial light at night (ALAN). Past studies have shown that bats, in general, respond to ALAN according to the emitted light color and that migratory bats, in particular, exhibit phototaxis in response to green light. As red and white light is frequently used in outdoor lighting, we asked how migratory bats respond to these wavelength spectra. At a major migration corridor, we recorded the presence of migrating bats based on ultrasonic recorders during 10-min light-on/light-off intervals to red or warm-white LED, interspersed with dark controls. When the red LED was switched on, we observed an increase in flight activity for Pipistrellus pygmaeus and a trend for a higher activity for Pipistrellus nathusii. As the higher flight activity of bats was not associated with increased feeding, we rule out the possibility that bats foraged at the red LED light. Instead, bats may have flown toward the red LED light source. When exposed to warm-white LED, general flight activity at the light source did not increase, yet we observed an increased foraging activity directly at the light source compared to the dark control. Our findings highlight a response of migratory bats toward LED light that was dependent on light color. The most parsimonious explanation for the response to red LED is phototaxis and for the response to warm-white LED foraging. Our findings call for caution in the application of red aviation lighting, particularly at wind turbines, as this light color might attract bats, leading eventually to an increased collision risk of migratory bats at wind turbines.",research,Latvia,44,25,25,4,40,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Bats were captured at two sites: one with wind farms and the other without. Blood and feces were collected and cortisol and corticosterone were measured by immunoassay. Glucocorticoid contents were not significantly different between sites with or without wind turbines for any of the four species, although they averaged higher at wind turbine sites. However, cortisol and corticosterone concentrations were different between the dry and rainy seasons. The elevated glucocorticoid levels during the dry season are possibly due to the high degree of physiological stress generated by their reproductive activity.

Approximately one million vultures and raptors traverse the area during the autumn migration season, and more than 60 species of nocturnally migrating birds have been recorded there. Furthermore, more than 60 bat species inhabit this region, which also harbors the most important wind resource area of the country. There, the number of wind turbines increased from 98 to >1500 between 2006 and 2015. We estimated bird and bat mortality at three wind farms in the Isthmus, correcting for different sources of bias. Between June and November 2015, we found 75 bird and 72 bat carcasses, belonging to 30 and 20 species respectively. Although we found more bird than bat carcasses, our corrected estimates are higher for bats than for birds. Corrected mortality ranges between 4.0 - 5.6 birds/MW and 9.08 - 21.23 bats/MW during the months of the study, or between 9.06 - 12.85 birds/MW/year and 20.47 - 43.79 bats/MW/year. Contrary to patterns of aerial vertebrate mortality at wind farms in temperate latitudes, all bat and most bird fatalities were from resident species, even when considering bird migration months only. Corrected bird mortality was highest at the wind farm with the tallest wind turbines. Our estimated fatalities/MW/year are higher than rates of bat and bird mortality recorded at numerous wind farms in the United States, and our estimates may still be biased low. Thus, our results offer a first glimpse to the magnitude of bird and bat mortality at this tropical hotspot for aerial vertebrates. More than 15 wind farms are currently operating in the region, hence a larger-scale effort is needed to fully understand the cumulative mortality of aerial vertebrates, particularly of resident species, at this wind energy hub and diversity hotspot.

Our study is based on a 5-year study (2009-2013) of bat captures using mist nets, acoustic recordings, and carcass searches at a wind farm in tropical southern Mexico. We investigated the composition of bat species, estimated the number of bat fatalities per turbine, and assessed the effect of the spatial attributes of vegetation cover near turbines on numbers of bat carcasses recovered by trophic guild. We recorded 29 bat species at the wind farm. The family Phyllostomidae was best represented in terms of number of species and individuals captured. Glossophaga soricina and G. morenoi exhibited the highest relative abundance, whereas Balantiopteryx plicata had the highest acoustic activity. We found 203 carcasses, including 73 Pteronotus davyi individuals (35.9%); other frequent species were Mormoops megalophylla, Molossus sinaloae, and Lasiurus intermedius. The total number of carcasses found within a year ranged from 17 to 83 (2012 and 2009, respectively), with the corrected estimates ranging from 410 to 1,980, or 4.18-20.20 fatalities/turbine. The number of carcasses recorded was positively correlated with secondary vegetation surrounding turbines but negatively correlated with agricultural fields. The spatial attributes of vegetation surrounding turbines influenced numbers of bat carcasses differentially depending on the bats' trophic guild and habitat use. Contrary to findings from United States and Canadian wind farms, most of the carcasses observed in our study were resident species. Notably, the most commonly captured and acoustically active species were not the most commonly found in carcass searches.

Bird and bat mortality caused by collisions with wind turbines can be estimated indirectly by counting carcasses within wind farms. However, carcass removal by scavengers often biases such measurements. In this study, we identified the main scavengers removing bird and bat carcasses in a tropical wind farm. A known fate analysis was done to assess the effect of carcass type (i.e., small bird, large bird, bat), vegetation type (i.e., secondary vegetation, croplands) and season (dry and rainy seasons of 2009) on carcass persistence rates. We identified three main scavenger groups, with mammals being the most abundant group. Our results show high rates of carcass removal relative to previous studies, especially for bats; there were fewer remaining carcasses after 20 days in our tropical site than in non-tropical environments reported elsewhere. We found a higher carcass persistence rate during the rainy season than in the dry season, possibly due to a greater abundance of food resources for scavenger organisms in the rainy season. Although we found some evidence for higher persistence rates for large bird carcasses than for small bird and bat carcasses during the rainy season. overall carcass type was not a strong predictor of persistence rates. Similarly, we did not find a strong effect of vegetation type on carcass persistence rates. Results suggest that in order to estimate accurate bird and bat mortality in tropical wind farm areas, seasonality should be incorporated to correction factors of carcass removal rates.

We present one of the first studies to quantify the indirect impact of wind farms on insectivorous bats in tropical hotspots of biodiversity. Bat activity was compared between wind farm sites and control sites, via ultrasound recordings at stationary points. The activity of bent winged bats (Miniopterus sp.) and wattled bats (Chalinolobus sp.) were both significantly lower at wind turbine sites. The result of the study demonstrates a large effect on bat habitat use at wind turbines sites compared to control sites. Bat activity was 20 times higher at control sites compared to wind turbine sites, which suggests that habitat loss is an important impact to consider in wind farm planning We strongly recommend that the loss of the foraging habitat loss is considered in mitigation hierarchy (avoiding, reducing, offsetting) when compensating for negative impacts of wind farms.",research,New Caledonia,37,21,22,7,134,ECOL ENG,Ecol.

Bat echolocation activity surveys are the standard method for assessing risk, but their effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Sites with relatively low pre-construction bat activity rates are predicted to yield relatively low post-construction fatality-rates (i.e., low risk), and vice-versa. To test this hypothesis, we ran simple linear regressions on bat activity rates and fatality rates from 49 paired pre- and post-construction studies across the United States and Canada. Bat activity rates did not predict bat fatality rates at wind energy facilities by detector height, by call frequency category of bats, or by season (P> 0.10). One possible explanation for the lack of a predictive relationship is that bat activity patterns may change between the pre- and post-construction periods if bats are attracted to turbines. Indeed, we found support that bat activity rates increased across call frequency category and season at four wind facilities that had measured hat activity rates before (x = 1.89 bat passes/detector-night) and after turbines were built ((x) over bar = 4.84 bat passes/detector-night). However, simple linear regressions of post-construction activity rates and fatality rates from 25 studies found no correlation between activity and fatality rates collected concurrently by detector height (ground, raised, nacelle) or by call frequency category (P > 0.05). We conclude that the current pre-construction survey methods of collecting bat activity rates at proposed wind energy facilities do not provide reliable information on how many bat fatalities there may be once the facility is built, and advocate exploring other methods for assessing risk to bats prior to wind development.",research,North America,59,14,14,3,13,ACTA CHIROPTEROL,Acta Chiropt.,JUN,2020,22,1,10.3161/15081109ACC2020.22.1.012,http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15081109ACC2020.22.1.012,,,12,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology

This data set, the largest compiled for bats to date, provides further evidence that collision mortality is greatest for migratory tree-roosting species (Hoary Bat [Lasiurus cinereus], Eastern Red Bat [Lasiurus borealis], Silver-haired Bat [Lasionycteris noctivagans]) and from July to October. Based on 40 U.S. studies meeting inclusion criteria and analyzed under a common statistical framework to account for methodological variation, we found support for an inverse relationship between bat mortality and percent grassland cover surrounding wind energy facilities. At a national scale, grassland cover may best reflect openness of the landscape, a factor generally associated with reduced activity and abundance of tree-roosting species that may also reduce turbine collisions. Further representative sampling of wind energy facilities is required to validate this pattern.

We synthesized available information on patterns of bat fatalities from a review of 21 postconstruction fatality studies conducted at 19 facilities in 5 United States regions and one Canadian province. Dominance of migratory, foliage- and tree-roosting lasiurine species (e.g., hoary bat [Lasiurus cincreus]) killed by turbines was consistent among studies. Bat fatalities, although highly variable and periodic, consistently peaked in late summer and fall, coinciding with migration of lasiurines and other species. A notable exception was documented fatalities of pregnant female Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) in May and June at a facility in Oklahoma, USA, and female silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) during spring in Tennessee, USA, and Alberta, Canada. Most studies reported that fatalities were distributed randomly across turbines at a site, although the highest number of fatalities was often found near the end Of turbine strings. Two studies conducted simultaneously in the same region documented similar timing of fatalities between sites, which suggests broader patterns of collisions dictated by weather, prey abundance, or other factors. None of the studies found differences in bat fatalities between turbines equipped with lighting required by the Federal Aviation Administration and turbines that were unlit. All studies that addressed relationships between bat fatalities and weather patterns found that most bats were killed on nights with low wind speed (<6 m/sec) and that fatalities increased immediately before and after passage of storm fronts. Weather patterns may be predictors of bat activity and fatality; thus, mitigation efforts that focus on these high-risk periods could reduce bat fatality substantially. We caution that estimates of bat fatality are conditioned by length of study and search interval and that they are biased in relation to how searcher efficiency, scavenger removal, and habitat differences were or were not accounted for. Our review will assist managers, biologists, and decision-makers with understanding unifying and unique patterns of bat fatality, biases, and limitations of existing efforts, and it will aid in designing future research needed to develop mitigation strategies for minimizing or eliminating bat fatality at wind facilities.",research,North America,75,337,365,4,327,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Observations of bat fatalities at wind farms raise concern about impacts to biodiversity, particularly amid projections of wind energy build-out. We investigated how continued wind energy development in the United States and Canada, as well as adoption of measures to reduce bat fatality rates, influence the population viability of the hoary bat (L. cinereus). Our model included uncertainty about population size and dynamics as well as future wind energy development. Results indicate that current levels of wind energy build-out may have already caused substantial population declines. Under our lowest-risk scenario of high maximum growth rate and low wind energy build-out, the median simulated population of 2.25 million hoary bats experienced a 50% decline by 2028. We show that risks of decline and extinction may still be mediated with rapid adoption of measures to reduce bat fatalities. We find that levels of fatality reduction shown to be achievable in empirical studies of fatality minimization, by turbine curtailment, may be sufficient to manage risks. Simulations of population trends suggest that declines exceeding 5% per year support fatality reduction to manage extinction risk. Importantly, both the risks and the level of fatality reduction necessary to manage them were highly uncertain.

Although most North American bats have large range sizes and large populations, as of 2015, 18-31% of the species were at risk (categorized as having vulnerable, imperiled, or critically imperiled NatureServe conservation statuses) and therefore among the most imperiled terrestrial vertebrates on the continent. Species richness is greatest in the Southwest, but at-risk species were more concentrated in the East, and northern faunas had the highest proportion of at-risk species. Most ecological traits considered, including those characterizing body size, roosting habits, migratory behavior, range size, home range size, population density, and tendency to hibernate, were not strongly associated with conservation status. However, nectarivorous bats tended to be more at risk. The conservation status of bats improved from 1985 to 2000 as human disturbances to roosting sites were reduced, but then declined sharply (7%) by 2015 due principally to threats from WNS and wind energy. Although uncertainty about threats from pollution and climate change remain, past experience shows that when threats are clearly identified and management actions taken, populations can recover.",research,North America,103,38,38,7,85,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

However, there are concerns regarding bird and bat fatalities at wind turbines. To assess the influence of turbine size on bird and bat fatalities, we analyzed data from North American wind energy facilities. Diameter of the turbine rotor did not influence the rate of bird or bat fatality. The height of the turbine tower had no effect on bird fatalities per turbine, but bat fatalities increased exponentially with tower height. This suggests that migrating bats fly at lower altitudes than nocturnally migrating birds and that newer, larger turbines are reaching that airspace. Minimizing tower height may help minimize bat fatalities. In addition, while replacing older, smaller turbines with fewer larger ones may reduce bird fatalities per megawatt, it may result in increased numbers of bat fatalities.",research,North America,55,134,144,4,156,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Compared to migratory birds and other more conspicuous migrants, we know very little about the movement patterns of many migratory bats. Hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), a cryptic, wide-ranging, long-distance migrant, comprise a substantial proportion of the tens to hundreds of thousands of bat fatalities estimated to occur each year at wind turbines in North America. We created seasonally-dynamic species distribution models (SDMs) from 2,753 museum occurrence records collected over five decades in North America to better understand the seasonal geographic distributions of hoary bats. We used 5 SDM approaches: logistic regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, boosted regression trees, random forest, and maximum entropy and consolidated outputs to generate ensemble maps. These maps represent the first formal hypotheses for sex-and season-specific hoary bat distributions. Our results suggest that North American hoary bats winter in regions with relatively long growing seasons where temperatures are moderated by proximity to oceans, and then move to the continental interior for the summer. SDMs suggested that hoary bats are most broadly distributed in autumn-the season when they are most susceptible to mortality from wind turbines; this season contains the greatest overlap between potentially suitable habitat and wind energy facilities. Comparing wind-turbine fatality data to model outputs could test many predictions, such as 'risk from turbines is highest in habitats between hoary bat summering and wintering grounds'. Although future field studies are needed to validate the SDMs, this study generated well-justified and testable hypotheses of hoary bat migration patterns and seasonal distribution.",research,North America,84,37,39,7,86,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,24-Jul,2015,10,7,10.1371/journal.pone.0132599,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0132599,,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Management decisions can be limited by a lack of understanding of the geographic impact of bats killed at wind-energy facilities. Several studies have leveraged stable hydrogen isotope ratios (delta H-2) of bat fur to illuminate this issue but are limited in the precision of conclusion because delta H-2 values vary primarily across latitudinal and elevational bands. One approach to increase the precision of geographic assignment is to combine independent inferences about spatial location from additional biomarkers and other related information. To test this possibility, we assigned known-origin individuals of three bat species (Lasiurus borealis, L. cinereus, and Lasionycteris noctivagans) commonly killed at on-shore wind-energy facilities in North America to a probable origin using delta H-2 values, trace element concentrations, and species distribution models. We used cross-validated calibrated combined model tuning to determine the degree to which assignment probabilities improved when combining datasets. We found that combining markers typically performed better than single approaches. For Lasiurus borealis and L. cinereus, combining all three data sources outperformed any single or other combined approach. With an accuracy set at 80%, an average of 39.7% and 36.0% of each species' total geographic range was considered a potential origin, respectively; stable hydrogen alone included 51.8% and 50.6% of the total geographic area. In contrast, for Lasionycteris noctivagans, including trace elements did not increase precision and adding distribution data to delta H-2 values only improved precision by 0.6%. Thus, we found that a combination of multiple biomarkers typically, but not always, outperforms single-marker approaches and optimized combinations of different markers outperform equal weighting of each marker. From a practical perspective, delta H-2 values performed better than trace elements alone; in cases where cost is a limiting factor, the stable hydrogen should be the single biomarker used in conjunction with species distribution models. Overall, these results highlight the importance of validating methods for each species they are applied to and show that combining information from intrinsic biomarker approaches is a useful tool to document bat movements.",research,North America,70,0,0,3,3,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,JUN,2023,14,6,10.1002/ecs2.4588,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4588,,,15,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology

This challenge is illustrated by the hundreds of thousands of migratory bats killed annually during autumn migration by industrial wind turbines. It is unknown why bats are killed at turbines because they are so difficult to observe during migration. A conservation behaviour approach has potential to explain what is, arguably, the most significant environmental impact of wind energy. We tested predictions of two hypotheses to explain the presence of bats at turbines: (1) bats are attracted to visually conspicuous tall structures during autumn migration; (2) attraction is linked to social behaviour rather than foraging. We compared acoustic activity of migratory tree bats at conspicuous tall structures (telecommunication towers) to activity at two types of control sites (woodlot edges: consistently attractive to bats; open fields: consistently unattractive) before and during migration. Activity of migratory bats increased dramatically at towers during migration, from low premigration levels, to exceed that at open fields and match that at woodlots. Moreover, the proportion of feeding calls at towers remained low while the proportion of events during which multiple bats visited the towers simultaneously increased during migration to surpass that at woodlots and open fields. This suggests that migratory bats actively visit tall structures during migration for reasons other than foraging. Exploiting this behaviour, and the abundance of communication towers on the landscape, could reveal critical information about migratory behaviour of bats and help guide site selection for wind energy projects. Our findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the behaviour of migratory species at all stages of their annual cycle for effective conservation.

Here, we review and qualitatively describe trends in the occurrence and apparent causes of multiple mortality events (MMEs) in bats around the world. We compiled a database of MMEs, defined as cases in which10 dead bats were counted or estimated at a specific location within a maximum timescale of a year, and more typically within a few days or a season. We tabulated 1180 MMEs within nine categories. Prior to 2000, intentional killing by humans caused the greatest proportion of MMEs in bats. In North America and Europe, people typically killed bats because they were perceived as nuisances. Intentional killing occurred in South America for vampire bat control, in Asia and Australia for fruit depredation control, and in Africa and Asia for human food. Biotic factors, accidents, and natural abiotic factors were also important historically. Chemical contaminants were confirmed causes of MMEs in North America, Europe, and in islands. Viral and bacterial diseases ranked low as causes of MMEs in bats. Two factors led to a major shift in causes of MMEs in bats at around 2000: the global increase of industrial wind-power facilities and the outbreak of white-nose syndrome in North America. Collisions with wind turbines and white-nose syndrome are now the leading causes of reported MMEs in bats. Collectively, over half of all reported MMEs were of anthropogenic origin. The documented occurrence of MMEs in bats due to abiotic factors such as intense storms, flooding, heat waves, and drought is likely to increase in the future with climate change. Coupled with the chronic threats of roosting and foraging habitat loss, increasing mortality through MMEs is unlikely to be compensated for, given the need for high survival in the dynamics of bat populations.",research,"North America, Europe",88,199,210,7,269,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,JUL,2016,46,3,10.1111/mam.12064,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.12064,,,16,Ecology; Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology

There is growing concern that land-based wind development in North America is negatively impacting bat populations, primarily long-distance migrating bats, but the impacts to bats from offshore wind energy are unknown. Bats are associated with the terrestrial environment, but have been observed over the ocean. In this review, we synthesize historic and contemporary accounts of bats observed and acoustically recorded in the North American marine environment to ascertain the spatial and temporal distribution of bats flying offshore. We incorporate studies of offshore bats in Europe and of bat behavior at land-based wind energy studies to examine how offshore wind development could impact North American bat populations. We find that most offshore bat records are of long-distance migrating bats and records occur during autumn migration, the period of highest fatality rates for long-distance migrating bats at land-based wind facilities in North America. We summarize evidence that bats may be attracted to offshore turbines, potentially increasing their exposure to risk of collision. However, higher wind speeds offshore can potentially reduce the amount of time that bats are exposed to risk. We identify knowledge gaps and hypothesize that a combination of operational minimization strategies may be the most effective approach for reducing impacts to bats and maximizing offshore energy production.",review,"North America, Europe",142,4,4,4,19,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We provide an overview of approaches to mitigate impacts of onshore wind energy development on wildlife, following steps in the mitigation hierarchy, including avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation. Planning and avoiding predicted high-risk areas is fundamental to reduce impacts on birds and bats. Contrary to avoidance, once facilities are built, options to minimize impacts need to be tailored to species at the specific site, and can be limited especially for bats. Curtailing wind turbine operations is the only approach proven effective at reducing bat mortality. While curtailment may in part also be effective for birds, micro-siting and repowering also are likely to reduce mortality. Compensation should be considered only as part of the mitigation hierarchy when unforeseen or unavoidable impacts remain. Offsite habitat-based compensatory measures may provide the best offsets for incidental bird and bat mortality. While the conceptual framework and predictive modelling for compensatory measures are well-established, empirical evidence demonstrating effectiveness and achievement of no-net loss for wildlife populations is lacking. Similarly, few studies have evaluated effectiveness of minimization measures and other forms of mitigation. Evaluating effectiveness of pre-construction wildlife assessments and habitat modeling in predicting wildlife mortality at wind facilities remains a research need. Additionally, lack of population data for many species of wildlife hinders knowledge of population-level impacts and effectiveness of mitigation measures.

Literature yielded evidence that construction, operation and maintenance of wind facilities affect mortality and behavior of mammals and birds as well as habitat suitability. However, the extent to which wind power plants affect shrub- and woodland-dwelling wildlife species highly depends on speciesspecific habitat requirements and distance thresholds, thereby indicating the urgent need of further studies, which reach beyond the scale of a single case study.

Despite the clear environmental benefits associated with this type of technology, many studies have confirmed bat fatalities at wind farms, which raise concerns about the long-term effects of these structures on bat populations. To investigate the impact of windmills on bat species, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM) to replicate the underlying behavioural mechanisms for individuals of the species Nyctalus leisleri involved when navigating their habitats at a landscape level, and to simulate the associated mortality events. A set of environmental data layers was used to develop a grid representing a real landscape in terms of habitat types, foraging availability and collision-risk. The model variables were estimated using values from literature. The simulations confirmed the species predominant selection of specific foraging areas and its high mobility, evidenced by the maximum distances to roosts and home range sizes, highly correlated with the habitats coniferous forests and broadleaf forests. High wind speeds (>= 4 m/s) were associated with a decrease in the number of expected fatalities, due to the behavioural limitations imposed to bat activity. Additionally, there was a clear relationship between mortality events and the proximity between roosts and the location of the wind turbines. Overall, these results elucidate the most likely foraging habitats used by the species and the relative risk of the location of windmills. They can inspire future studies of how bat species respond to the infrastructural impacts related with wind farms in mountain areas and/or to the pertinent mitigation measures implemented.

SWTs are installed in a wider range of habitats compared to wind farms and their effect on wildlife can therefore be different. While single SWTs can adversely affect bat activity in their immediate vicinity, they are often installed in clusters, and to date, no data are available on whether installation of more than one turbine increases the likelihood of adverse effects on bats. Here, we test whether (1) SWT installations affect the activity of two species of bat (the common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus and soprano pipistrelle P. pygmaeus) on a landscape scale (here defined as up to 500m from SWTs) and (2) such an effect is stronger when multiple (2-4) SWTs are installed. We show that, after accounting for potentially confounding effects (e.g. variation in habitat and weather), (1) mean P. pipistrellus activity is lower at 0-100m compared to 200-500m from SWTs and (2) the effect on P. pygmaeus activity tends to be similar and stronger in multiple SWT sites, although evidence for the latter is limited. We conclude that in some cases, adverse effects of SWTs on bat activity may be measurable over longer spatial scales (within 100m) than previously thought. However, combined with earlier findings, it is likely that the bulk of such effects operate within relative close proximity of SWTs (<25m). Moreover, although these effects may be species-specific, with, for example, P. pygmaeus potentially more strongly affected by multiple SWT sites, this requires further data. These findings are highly relevant to decision-making aimed at minimizing any adverse effects of wind turbines, specifically single- versus multiple SWT developments, on wildlife.",research,Scotland,30,10,10,0,48,ANIM CONSERV,Anim.

In La Rioja and Soria, where wind farms mostly are located at higher elevations, fatalities occurred between May and October and without any obvious late summer peak. The reports reviewed here revealed many deficiencies in their protocols that prevent comparisons with other studies nationally and internationally. For example, only five reports (9%) accounted for searcher efficiency or carcass removal biases. Consequently, fatality estimates appeared to be negatively associated with the number of turbines in the wind farm and also with the monitoring frequency, so that fewer bats seem to be killed when the monitoring intervals were longer.

Results show that the 10 x 10 km UTM squares occupied by wind power plants fell within the range of more bat and bird species than squares free of these infrastructures. For species included in the Spanish Red List, there were more wind power plants than expected inside the range of two raptors (Neophron percnopterus and Circus pygargus) and less than expected in six species (Ciconia nigra, Aquila adalberti, Hieraetus fasciatus Myotis capaccinii, Rhinolophus mehelyi and Myotis myotis). The rest of endangered species (15) had a range occupation similar to that predicted by random sampling, a result that reflects a poor strategy to prevent the overlap. These patterns may be explained by the small amount of overlap of the range of many of these animals with the windiest areas in Spain, where wind power plants are concentrated today. However, this situation is changing rapidly with the densification and expansion of wind power plants promoted under the Spanish Plan of Renewable Energies.

Consequently, techniques that effectively reduce avian collision rates are necessary. One of such method is the stop-turbine system, otherwise known as a Turbine Shutdown System (TSS). Here, we analyzed changes in mortality during 15 years, starting two years before the application of a selective stopping protocol (2006-2007) and after 13 years of application (2008-2020). This protocol was applied in Cadiz area (southern Spain) to 20 wind farms, totaling 269 wind turbines. The priority in the shutdown protocol was to avoid large soaring birds, mainly raptors, collisions. In total, 2903 birds and 354 bats were found to have collided with wind turbines in this 15-year period. This represents a rate of 0.830 birds/turbine/year and 0.101 bats/turbine/year. After implementation of the selective stopping protocol, we found a significant reduction of 61.7 % in mortality of soaring birds (mainly raptors and storks). Considering only mortality records of Griffon Vultures, a reduction of 92.8 % was achieved. Counts of Griffon Vultures increased more than 7-fold during the study period, and number of turbine stops due to vultures at risk in wind farms, also increased by around 2.5 times. Our finding of Griffon Vulture mortality being reduced by over 92 % through turbine shutdowns was associated with only an estimated loss of less than 0.51 % in energy production.

Bat mortality occurred mainly during the summer and autumn, especially in August. However, species such as the genus Pipistrellus, present collisions throughout the year, including all winter months in the case of the genus Pipistrellus. The probability of mortality was positively correlated with the maximum daily temperature. According to the model prediction, the probability of fatality begins to increase slightly from 20 & DEG;C and then rises sharply when the temperature exceeds 30 & DEG;C, that can be interpreted as a consequence of increasing bat activity at local scale.

We investigate the effect of carcass size, vegetation characteristics and weather conditions on the probability of detecting a carcass, for both dogs and humans, using data from the monitoring program of a wind farm in Spain. 3. A generalized linear mixed model reveals a high performance of dogs (similar to 80% detection rate), with no clear influence of any of the variables analysed. Humans, on the contrary, were markedly affected by the size of the carcass and to some extent, by the vegetation structure. Humans performed poorly at detecting small carcasses (similar to 20% detection rate), more so in closed vegetation. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide evidence that dogs perform with high success rates at detecting bird and bat carcasses of different sizes under a wide range of environmental conditions. Humans, by contrast, were very poor at detecting all but the largest carcasses in open areas.

One hypothesis is that bats visit wind turbines to feed on insects exposed at the turbine towers. We used single molecule next generation DNA sequencing to identify stomach contents of 18 bats of four species (Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Nyctalus noctula, Eptesicus nilssonii and Vespertilio murinus) found dead under wind turbines in southern Sweden. Stomach contents were diverse but included typically diurnal flies, e.g. blow-flies (Calliphoridae), flesh-flies (Sarcophagidae) and houseflies (Muscidae) and also several flightless taxa. Such prey items were eaten by all bat species and at all wind turbine localities and it seems possible that they had been captured at or near the surface of the turbines at night. Using sticky traps, we documented an abundance of swarming (diurnal) ants (Myrmica spp.) and sometimes blow-flies and houseflies at the nacelle house. Near the base of the tower the catches were more diverse and corresponded better with the taxa found in the bat stomachs, including various diurnal flies. To evaluate if flies and other insects resting on the surface of a wind turbine are available to bats, we ensonified a house fly (Musca) on a smooth (plastic) surface with synthetic ultrasonic pulses of the frequencies used by the bat species that we had sampled. The experiment revealed potentially useful echoes, provided the attack angle was low and the frequency high (50-75 kHz). Hence resting flies and other arthropods can probably be detected by echolocating bats on the surface of a wind turbine. Our findings are consistent with published observations of the behavior of bats at wind turbines and may actually explain the function of some of these behaviors.

As new wind farms are erected in increasing numbers, they will have an impact on many organisms, e.g., through habitat changes and collision mortalities. In this study, we measure bat activity, insect abundance, and weather conditions to test the hypothesis that insect abundance attracts bats to wind turbines because of feeding opportunities. We found that the relationship between insect abundance and bat activity was relatively weak, providing some support for the feeding-attraction hypothesis. However, we also found a strong correlation between bat passes and weather conditions. This suggests that stop-regulation based on weather conditions might be a solution to avoid collisions. However, this study highlights some of the problems with defining the limits for stop-regulation, as bat activity may be high also at relatively high wind speeds and low temperatures. We present data on species composition and activity of bats during two years at three different wind- turbines, located in south Sweden, both at the base and nacelle height. To test the hypothesis that bats are attracted to wind turbines because of feeding opportunities, insects were sampled at nacelle height at one wind turbine using a suction trap, simultaneously as bat activity were measured. At this wind turbine, we also compared two different technical systems for ultrasound recordings and collect meteorological data. The variation in bat activity was high between nights and between wind turbines. In addition to the expected open-air foraging species (Pipistrellus, Nyctalus, Vespertilio and Eptesicus), some individuals of unexpected species (Myotis, Barbastella, and Plecotus) were found at nacelle height. There was a weak but significant positive relation between bat activity and insect abundance, so the hypothesis could not be rejected, suggesting there might be other factors than insect abundance explaining the frequency of bat visits at the nacelle. We found a strong correlation between bat passes and weather conditions. A reasonable way to mitigate collisions is with stop-regulation.

Since such conditions were unusual (five of 50 nights of observation) the visits by the bats were unlikely to be chance events (migrating bats passing the turbine), but more likely involved bats attracted to the turbines. However, no feeding buzzes were recorded and the bats never stayed near the turbine more than one minute. The turbines studied are lit by 250 W white lights and this could have been the reason why bats visited the turbines, because such lights potentially attract insects.

A longstanding question remains why bats are attracted to wind turbines and risk their lives among the moving rotor blades. One hypothesis is that they feed on insects swarming around the turbine towers and another is that they congregate there to court. The two are not mutually exclusive and may occur more or less simultaneously. It has been difficult to distinguish these hypothesis, because techniques that permit observations of small insects over the relevant distances (similar to 100 m) in the dark are lacking. In this study, we monitored insects at the top of a wind turbine using a novel high-resolution Scheimpflug lidar. The instru-ment was employed around dusk during ten late summer nights in 2018, with the principal aim to evaluate its performance under real field conditions. Insect swarms were observed near the top of the turbine tower on every night. They appeared in short intervals and varied in density, timing, exact location and size of the swarming insects from day to day. Swarms formed in the afternoon and either dispersed around sunset before the emer-gence of bats, or remained until darkness, when bats arrived at the turbine. Some of the bats fed there, as indicated by ultrasonic feeding-buzzes, and also engaged in social interactions possibly including courtship, as indicated by song-flights. Daily variation in the formation, dispersal and behavior of the insect swarms appeared to be influenced by temperature and wind speed and also differed among the insect species.",research,Sweden,51,15,15,5,30,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

This is because wind turbines are frequently constructed in barbastelle habitats and yet there is no national guideline on how the arising conflict should be handled. We studied the movement, behavior and mortality of a barbastelle population at a wind farm in southern Sweden, using radio-telemetry, automatic bat detectors and carcass searches. The tagged bats (6 males and 8 females) roosted mainly under loose bark of dead oak trees and foraged in patches of mature deciduous woodlands or pockets of mature spruce trees within 15 km of the roosts. Extensive areas of young spruce plantation, open farmland and lakes were not used for roosting or foraging but were crossed by commuting bats. Continuous recordings with bat detectors frequently picked up barbastelles at forest edges 30 m from the turbines, but rarely over the turbine pads within 10 m from the turbines and never at heights of 30 and 100 m at the turbine towers. Barbastelles were apparently not attracted to the wind turbines and did not seem to interact with them in any way. Carcass searches under 10 wind turbines at 1-week intervals over three summers did not reveal any dead barbastelles, although three other species were recovered. We conclude that wind farming is not nessarily incompatible with effective conservation of barbastelles in Sweden, but instead of focusing on wind turbines, effors should concentrate on (a) preservation and restoration of mature, age-structured deciduous woodlands and spruce forests, including very small and isolated patches, which provide food and roosts, and probably also (b) avoidance of outdoor lighting in areas used by barbastelles. Designating large circular buffer zones around each known or suspected colony according to current practice would be inefficient or meaningless in our case, because barbastelles use extensive home ranges and switch roost frequently. We argue that barbastelle management must be applied on a landscape scale.",research,Sweden,40,9,9,3,39,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur. J. Wildl.

The altitude used for migration flight was most often < 10 m above sea level. Bats must use other sensory systems for long-distance navigation, but they probably use echoes from the water surface to orient to the immediate surroundings. Both migrant and resident bats foraged over the sea in areas with an abundance of insects in the air and crustaceans in the surface waters.

With increasing technical development, tall turbines (rotor-swept zone 50-150 m above ground level) are becoming widespread, yet we lack quantitative information about species active at these heights, which impedes proposing targeted mitigation recommendations for bat-friendly turbine operation. We investigated vertical activity profiles of a bat assemblage, and their relationships to wind speed, within a major valley of the European Alps where tall wind turbines are being deployed. To monitor bat activity we installed automatic recorders at sequentially increasing heights from ground level up to 65 m, with the goal to determine species-specific vertical activity profiles and to link them to wind speed. Bat call sequences were analysed with an automatic algorithm, paying particular attention to mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis and Myotis blythil) and the European free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis), three locally rare species. The most often recorded bats were the Common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savil). Mouse-eared bats were rarely recorded, and mostly just above ground, appearing out of risk of collision. T. teniotis had a more evenly distributed vertical activity profile, often being active at rotor level, but its activity at that height ceased above 5 ms(-1) wind speed. Overall bat activity in the rotor-swept zone declined with increasing wind speed, dropping below 5% above 5.4 ms(-1). Collision risk could be drastically reduced if nocturnal operation of tall wind turbines would be restricted to wind speeds above 5 ms(-1). Such measure should be implemented year-round because T. teniotis remains active in winter. This operational restriction is likely to cause only small energy production losses at these tall wind turbines, although further analyses are needed to assess these losses precisely.",research,Switzerland,51,26,28,1,40,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,21-Mar,2018,13,3,10.1371/journal.pone.0192493,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0192493,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Annual production of electric energy through the wind turbines in Turkey is only 2493 MW, which accounts for only 5.8% of the total energy consumption in the country. We discussed the possibilities of how this amount can be increased to 10%, over the next 35 years. Turkey, which has 502 bird species, is a part of the Palearctic, and is located on important bird migration routes. As a result, birds prefer the migration routes on the areas where the wind intensity is quite high. Certain areas in Turkey, such as Kapidagi peninsula, Iskenderun, Izmir, Belen, or Adana, are located on high wind intensity routes. Continuous monitoring programs for migratory bird species must be carried out for several years before the wind turbines are built on such areas. In this work, we discussed the collision effects of wind turbines on birds and bats, based on information obtained from literature and field observations both in Turkey and in several other countries. For example, the wind turbines in four states in the eastern part of the United States have only 0.003% share for bird deaths in the region. Similarly, it was found that only 0.23 individual bats died per year by wind turbines in Brandenburg, Germany. Similarly, the death rates of birds and bats caused by wind turbines are quite low compared to other human factors in Turkey. The available data indicate that death rates of birds and bats by wind turbines in relation to the other factors (e.g. by clashing up against glass windows of buildings) is quite low. Therefore, public oppositions against wind turbines are not well justified.

As a result, the impact of forest management practices on bats, such as clear felling, has received little attention, particularly in Europe. However, there is growing evidence from multiple regions that bats do make use of plantation landscapes, and as interest in siting onshore wind turbines in upland conifer plantations grows, there is an urgent need to examine whether felling prior to turbine installation is likely to put foraging bats at risk of collision. In the first study of its kind, we use a before - after - control - impact study to explore the short-term impacts of clear fell harvest on bat activity in commercial plantations. Thirty-one mature stands of Sitka Spruce were surveyed using acoustic detectors in three large, upland Sitka Spruce plantations in Britain. Eleven stands were felled between 2013 and 2015, and 26 of the original 31 stands were resurveyed in 2015. The change in total bat activity and species- or genus-specific bat activity was modelled before and after felling occurred at both felled and control stands using generalised linear models. There was no change in overall bat activity at felled sites compared to control sites, but activity of Nyctalus species was 23 times higher following felling. Total Pipistrellus spp. activity doubled at felled sites post-harvesting, although this was mainly driven by increased activity at a few felled sites. When P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus were considered separately, activity increased slightly but non significantly. The size of the felled area influenced activity (for bats overall and Pipistrellus spp.), with 90% higher activity in smaller felled stands (less than 5 ha(-1)) compared to larger felled stands (greater than 30 ha(-1)). For P. pipistrellus, activity in felled areas decreased with the duration since harvesting; the greatest activity occurred in stands felled within two months compared to those harvested more than 16 months previously. Higher activity for some groups following felling may occur due to the creation of more edge habitat, which is preferred by both Pipistrellus species we recorded. An increase in activity following the small-scale felling ('key-holing') required for the installation of turbines could put foraging bats at risk from collisions with turbines. Further investigation of the influence of both size of clear fell patch, timing of felling and changes in invertebrate abundance due to felling are required to establish the potential risk of key-holing and turbine installation to foraging bats.

Flexibility in size and design allow SWTs to be installed in a much wider range of settings compared to large wind turbines.

Thus, siting decisions for SWTs are currently made with considerable uncertainty of their impact on wildlife. We combined field data and questionnaire surveys of SWT owners to assess the range and correlates of bird and bat mortality at SWT sites (mean hub height 10.2 m [range 4.0-26.4 m], mean rotor diameter 4.0 m [range 0.9-15.0 m], for both free-standing and building mounted turbines).

Because bats rely on information contained in high-frequency echoes to determine the nature and movement of a target, it is important to consider how ultrasonic pulses similar to those used by bats for echolocation may be interacting with operational turbine rotor blades. By assessing the characteristics of reflected ultrasonic echoes, moving turbine blades operating under low wind speed conditions (<6 m s(-1)) were found to produce distinct Doppler shift profiles at different angles to the rotor. Frequency shifts of up to +/- 700-800 Hz were produced, which may not be perceptible by some bat species. Monte Carlo simulation of bat-like sampling by echolocation revealed that over 50 rotor echoes could be required by species such as Pipistrellus pipistrellus for accurate interpretation of blade movement, which may not be achieved in the bat's approach time-window. In summary, it was found that echoes returned from moving blades had features which could render them attractive to bats or which might make it difficult for the bat to accurately detect and locate blades in sufficient time to avoid a collision.

Reducing these fatalities is essential to ensure that the global increase in wind-energy facilities can occur with minimal impact on bat populations. Although individual bats have been observed approaching wind turbines, and fatalities frequently reported, it is unclear whether bats are actively attracted to, indifferent to, or repelled by, the turbines at large wind-energy installations. In this study, we assessed bat activity at paired turbine and control locations at 23 British wind farms. The research focussed on Pipistrellus species, which were by far the most abundant bats recorded at these sites. P. pipistrellus activity was 37% higher at turbines than at control locations, whereas P. pygmaeus activity was consistent with no attraction or repulsion by turbines. Given that more than 50% of bat fatalities in Europe are P. pipistrellus, these findings help explain why Environmental Impact Assessments conducted before the installation of turbines are poor predictors of actual fatality rates.

We demonstrate that extensive presence-absence survey data can be collected for bats across a large (> 20,000 km(2)) region of southern Scotland using volunteers supplemented with additional fieldworker effort in remote areas. We advocate a survey design that allows data to be collected for all bat species, but provide more focused analyses on three species (Leisler's bat, noctule and Nathusius' pipistrelle) that are currently considered to be at highest risk from wind turbines. We estimate that between 16% and 24% of the regional populations of these three high risk species overlap existing and approved wind farms, with 50% of this overlap concentrated at just 10% of wind farms. This emphasises the importance of new wind farm placement to minimise impact on these species. We have stratified the region according to the potential impact on bats of future wind farm development, highlighting those areas in the top 1%, 5% and 10% of risk. We conclude that there is a need for higher quality data of this type in order to inform spatial models of bat distribution and activity.

We therefore determine whether the electromagnetic radiation associated with radar installations can elicit an aversive behavioural response in foraging bats. Four civil air traffic control (ATC) radar stations, three military ATC radars and three weather radars were selected, each surrounded by heterogeneous habitat. Three sampling points matched for habitat type and structure, dominant vegetation species, altitude and surrounding land class were located at increasing distances from each station. A portable electromagnetic field meter measured the field strength of the radar at three distances from the source: in close proximity (<200 m) with a high electromagnetic field (EMF) strength>2 volts/metre, an intermediate point within line of sight of the radar (200-400 m) and with an EMF strength<2 v/m, and a control site out of sight of the radar (>400 m) and registering an EMF of zero v/m. At each radar station bat activity was recorded three times with three independent sampling points monitored on each occasion, resulting in a total of 90 samples, 30 of which were obtained within each field strength category. At these sampling points, bat activity was recorded using an automatic bat recording station, operated from sunset to sunrise. Bat activity was significantly reduced in habitats exposed to an EMF strength of greater than 2 v/m when compared to matched sites registering EMF levels of zero. The reduction in bat activity was not significantly different at lower levels of EMF strength within 400 m of the radar.

Although large wind farms generate the majority of wind energy, the small wind turbine (SWT, units generating <50 kW) sector is growing rapidly.

We present the first study to quantify the effects of SWTs on birds and bats. Using a field experiment, we show that bird activity is similar in two distance bands surrounding a sample of SWTs (between 6-18 m hub height) and is not affected by SWT operation at the fine scale studied. At shorter distances from operating turbines (0-5 m), bat activity (measured as the probability of a bat pass'' per hour) decreases from 84% (71-91%) to 28% (11-54%) as wind speed increases from 0 to 14 m/s. This effect is weaker at greater distances (20-25 m) from operating turbines (activity decreases from 80% (65-89%) to 59% (32-81%)), and absent when they are braked. We conclude that bats avoid operating SWTs but that this effect diminishes within 20 m.

Following our demonstration that bat activity is reduced in the vicinity of large air traffic control and weather radars, we tested the hypothesis that an electromagnetic signal from a small portable radar can act as a deterrent to foraging bats. From June to September 2007 bat activity was compared at 20 foraging sites in northeast Scotland during experimental trials (radar switched on) and control trials (no radar signal). Starting 45 minutes after sunset, bat activity was recorded for a period of 30 minutes during each trial and the order of trials were alternated between nights. From July to September 2008 aerial insects at 16 of these sites were sampled using two miniature light-suction traps. At each site one of the traps was exposed to a radar signal and the other functioned as a control. Bat activity and foraging effort per unit time were significantly reduced during experimental trials when the radar antenna was fixed to produce a unidirectional signal therefore maximising exposure of foraging bats to the radar beam. However, although bat activity was significantly reduced during such trials, the radar had no significant effect on the abundance of insects captured by the traps.",research,United Kingdom,45,37,40,0,56,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,16-Jul,2009,4,7,10.1371/journal.pone.0006246,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006246,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Bats avoid ambient ultrasound in their environment and alter their echolocation calls in response to masking noise. Using stereo thermal videogrammetry and acoustic methods, we tested predictions that: (i) bats would avoid acoustic deterrents and forage and social call less in a 'treated airspace'; (ii) deterrents would cause bats to fly with more direct flight paths akin to commuting behaviour and in line with a reduction in foraging activity, resulting in increased flight speed and decreased flight tortuosity; and (iii) bats would alter their echolocation call structure in response to the masking deterrent sound. As predicted, overall bat activity was reduced by 30% and we recorded a significant reduction in counts of Pipistrellus pygmaeus (27%), Myotis spp. (probably M. daubentonii) (26%), and Nyctalus spp. and Eptesicus spp. (68%) passes. Pipistrellus pygmaeus feeding buzzes were also reduced by the deterrent in relation to general activity (by 38%); however, social calls were not (only 23% reduction). Bats also increased their flight speed and reduced the tortuosity of their flight paths, and P. pygmaeus reduced echolocation call bandwidth and start frequency of calls in response to deterrent playback, probably owing to the masking effect of the sound.

We also performed BACI experiments during a 3-year study of curtailment and operational effects on bird fatalities among wind turbines of varying operational status (study 2). In study 1, wind turbine curtailment significantly reduced near-misses and rotor-disrupted flights of bats, and it significantly reduced fatalities of bats but not of birds. In study 2, converting wind turbines from inoperable to operable status did not significantly increase bird fatalities, and bird species of hole or sheltered-ledge nesters or roosters on human-made structures died in substantial numbers at vacant towers. Of bird species represented by fatalities in study 2, 79% were found at inoperable wind turbines. Because the migration season is relatively brief, seasonal curtailment would greatly reduce bat fatalities for a slight loss in annual energy generation, but it might not benefit many bird species.

Operational mitigation that limits operation may reduce fatalities but also limits energy production. We incorporated both temperature and wind speed into an operational mitigation design fine-tuned to conditions when bats are most active in order to improve economic efficiency of mitigation. We conducted a 2-year study at the Sheffield Wind Facility in Sheffield, Vermont. Activity of bats is highest when winds speeds are low (< 6.0 m/s) and, in our region, when temperatures are above 9.5 degrees C. We tested for a reduction in bat mortality when cut-in speed at treatment turbines was raised from 4.0 to 6.0 m/s whenever nightly wind speeds were < 6.0 m/s and temperatures were >9.5 degrees C. Mortalities at fully operational turbines were 1.52-4.45 times higher than at treatment turbines. During late spring and early fall, when overnight temperatures generally fell below 9.5 degrees C, incorporating temperature into the operational mitigation design decreased energy losses by 18%.

We tested the effectiveness of 2 management actions at 2 wind-energy facilities for reducing bat fatalities: curtailing turbine operation when wind speeds were <5.0 m/second and combining curtailment with an acoustic bat deterrent developed by NRG Systems. We measured the effectiveness of the management actions using differences in counts of bat carcasses quantified by daily and twice-per-week standardized carcass searches of cleared plots below turbines, and field trials that estimated searcher efficiency and carcass persistence. We studied turbines located at 2 adjacent wind-energy facilities in northeast Illinois, USA, during fall migration (1 Aug-15 Oct) in 2018. We estimated the effectiveness of each management action using a generalized linear mixed-effects model with several covariates. Curtailment alone reduced overall bat mortality by 42.5% but did not reduce silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) mortality. Overall bat fatality rates were 66.9% lower at curtailed turbines with acoustic deterrents compared to turbines that operated at manufacturer cut-in speed. Curtailment and the deterrent reduced bat mortality to varying degrees between species, ranging from 58.1% for eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) to 94.4 for big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). Hoary (Lasiurus cinereus) and silver-haired bat mortality was reduced by 71.4% and 71.6%, respectively.

We estimated the additional reduction in mortality with concurrent deployment of the acoustic deterrent and curtailment under the assumption that curtailment and the acoustic deterrent would have reduced mortality by the same percentage at adjacent wind-energy facilities. Acoustic deterrents resulted in 31.6%, 17.4%, and 66.7% additional reductions of bat mortality compared to curtailment alone for eastern red bat, hoary bat, and silver-haired bat, respectively. The effectiveness of acoustic deterrents for reducing bat mortality at turbines with rotor-swept area diameters >110 m is unknown because high frequency sound attenuates quickly, which reduces coverage of rotor-swept areas.

Estimates of fatality, corrected for field biases, were compared between treatment and control turbines. In 2009, we estimated 21-51% fewer bats were killed per treatment turbine than per control turbine. In 2010, we determined an approximate 9% inherent difference between treatment and control turbines and when factored into our analysis, variation increased and between 2% more and 64% fewer bats were killed per treatment turbine relative to control turbines. We estimated twice as many hoary bats were killed per control turbine than treatment turbine, and nearly twice as many silver-haired bats in 2009. In 2010, although we estimated nearly twice as many hoary bats and nearly 4 times as many silver-haired bats killed per control turbine than at treatment turbines during the treatment period, these only represented an approximate 20% increase in fatality relative to the pre-treatment period for these species when accounting for inherent differences between turbine sets. Our findings suggest broadband ultrasound broadcasts may reduce bat fatalities by discouraging bats from approaching sound sources. However, effectiveness of ultrasonic deterrents is limited by distance and area ultrasound can be broadcast, in part due to rapid attenuation in humid conditions.

The fatalities associated with this behavior continue to be an issue for wind energy development and wildlife conservation. We tested an experimental method intended to reduce bat fatalities at the wind turbines. We assumed that bats navigate over long distances at night by dim-light vision and might be dissuaded from approaching artificially lit structures. For over a year, we experimentally lit wind turbines at night with dim, flickering ultraviolet (UV) light while measuring the presence and activity of bats, birds, and insects with thermal-imaging cameras. We detected no statistical differences in the activity of the bats, insects, or birds at a test turbine when lit with UV light compared with that of unlit nights. Additional experiments to test this or other possible bat-deterrence methods may benefit from considering subtle measures of animal response that can provide useful information on the possible behavioral effects of fatality-reduction experiments. Wind energy producers need deployable devices for wind turbines that prevent bat fatalities. Based on the speculation that bats approach turbines after visually mistaking them for trees, we tested a potential light-based deterrence method. It is likely that the affected bats see ultraviolet (UV) light at low intensities. Here, we present the results of a multi-month experiment to cast dim, flickering UV light across wind turbine surfaces at night. Our objectives were to refine and test a practical system for dimly UV-illuminating turbines while testing whether the experimental UV treatment influenced the activity of bats, birds, and insects. We mounted upward-facing UV light arrays on turbines and used thermal-imaging cameras to quantify the presence and activity of night-flying animals. The results demonstrated that the turbines can be lit to the highest reaches of the blades with invisible UV light, and the animal responses to such experimental treatment can be concurrently monitored. The UV treatment did not significantly change nighttime bat, insect, or bird activity at the wind turbine.

Particularly, estimates suggest hundreds of thousands of bat fatalities occur annually at wind plants across North America, with potential implications for the viability of several bat species. One approach to reducing bat fatalities is shutting down (or curtailing) turbines when bats are most at risk, such as at night during relatively low wind speed periods throughout summer and early autumn. While curtailment has consistently been shown to reduce bat fatalities, the lost power production reduces revenues for wind plants. This study conducted simulations with a range of curtailment scenarios across the contiguous United States to examine sensitivities of annual energy production (AEP) loss and potential impacts on economic metrics for future wind energy deployment. We found that AEP reduction can vary across the country from less than 1% to more than 10% for different curtailment scenarios. From an estimated 2891 gigawatts (GW) of simulated economically viable wind capacity (measured by a positive net present value), we found the mid curtailment scenario (6.0 m/s wind speed cut-in from July 1 through October 31) reduced the quantity of economic wind capacity by 274 GW or 9.5%.

This study tests a novel approach for reducing bat fatalities and curtailment time at a wind energy facility in the United States, then compares these results to operational mitigation techniques used at other study sites in North America and Europe. The study was conducted in Wisconsin during 2015 using a new system of tools for analyzing bat activity and wind speed data to make near real-time curtailment decisions when bats are detected in the area at control turbines (N = 10) vs. treatment turbines (N = 10). The results show that this smart curtailment approach (referred to as Turbine Integrated Mortality Reduction, TIMR) significantly reduced fatality estimates for treatment turbines relative to control turbines for pooled species data, and for each of five species observed at the study site: pooled data (-84.5%); eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis, -82.5%); hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus, -81.4%); silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans, -90.9%); big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus, -74.2%); and little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus, -91.4%). The approach reduced power generation and estimated annual revenue at the wind energy facility by <= 3.2% for treatment turbines relative to control turbines, and we estimate that the approach would have reduced curtailment time by 48% relative to turbines operated under a standard curtailment rule used in North America. This approach significantly reduced fatalities associated with all species evaluated, each of which has broad distributions in North America and different ecological affinities, several of which represent species most affected by wind development in North America.

In an effort to reduce impacts of wind energy production on bat populations, many facilities implement operational curtailment strategies that limit turbine blade rotation during conditions when nighttime wind speeds are low. Incorporating real-time bat activity data into wind speed-only curtailment (WOC) strategies may increase operational flexibility by allowing turbines to operate normally when bats are not present near turbines. We evaluated costs and benefits of implementing the Turbine Integrated Mortality Reduction (TIMR) system, an approach that informs a curtailment-triggering algorithm based on wind speed and real-time bat acoustic data, compared to a WOC strategy in which turbines were curtailed below 4.5 meters per second (m/s) at a wind energy facility in Fond Du Lac County, Wisconsin. TIMR is a proprietary system and we had no access to the acoustic data or bat call analysis software. Operational parameters for the TIMR system were set to allow curtailment at all wind speeds below 8.0 m/s during the study period when bats were acoustically detected. Overall, the TIMR system reduced fatalities by 75% compared to control turbines, while the WOC strategy reduced fatalities by 47%. An earlier analysis of the same TIMR data neglected to account for carcasses occurring outside the plot boundary and estimated an 84.5% fatality reduction due to the TIMR system. Over the study period, bat activity led to curtailment of TIMR turbines during 39.4% of nighttime hours compared to 31.0% of nighttime hours for WOC turbines, and revenue losses were approximately 280% as great for TIMR turbines as for turbines operated under the WOC strategy. The large cost difference between WOC and TIMR was driven by the 4.5 m/s versus 8.0 m/s wind speed thresholds for curtailment, but our study site has a relatively low average wind speed, which may also have contributed; other wind operators considering the TIMR system will need to consider their ability to absorb production losses in relation to their need to reduce bat fatality rates.",intervention,United States of America,33,4,4,5,9,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,,2022,17,4,10.1371/journal.pone.0266500,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266500,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Site-specific studies have demonstrated that bat activity is higher during lower wind speeds and that operational curtailment can effectively reduce fatalities. However, the exact nature of the relationship between curtailment cut-in speed and bat fatality reduction remains unclear. To evaluate the efficacy of differing curtailment regimes in reducing bat fatalities, we examined data from turbine curtailment experiments in the United States and Canada in a meta-analysis framework. We used multiple statistical models to explore possible linear and non-linear relationships between turbine cut-in speed and bat fatality. Because the overall sample size for this meta-analysis was small (n = 36 control-treatment studies from 17 wind farms), we conducted a power analysis to assess the number of control-treatment curtailment studies needed to understand the relationship between fatality reduction and change in cut-in speed. We also identified the characteristics of individual curtailment field studies that may influence their power to detect fatality reductions, and in turn, contribute to future meta-analyses. We found strong evidence that implementing turbine curtailment reduces fatality rates of bats at wind farms; the estimated fatality ratio across all studies was 0.37 (p < 0.001), or a 63% decrease in fatalities. However, the nature of the relationship between the magnitude of treatment and reduction in fatalities was more difficult to assess. Models that represented the response ratio as a continuous variable (e.g., with a linear relationship between the change in cut-in speed and fatalities) and a categorical variable (to allow for possible non-linearity in this relationship) both had substantial support when compared using AIC(c). The linear model represented the best fit, likely due to model simplicity, but the non-linear model was the most likely without accounting for parsimony and suggested fatality rates decreased when the difference in curtailment cut-in speeds was 2m/s or larger. The power analyses showed that the power to detect effects in the meta-analysis was low if fatality reductions were less than 50%, which suggests that smaller increases in cut-in speed (i.e., between different treatment categories) may not be easily detectable with the current dataset. While curtailment is an effective operational mitigation measure overall, additional well-designed curtailment studies are needed to determine precisely whether higher cut-in speeds can further reduce bat fatalities.",intervention,United States of America,52,14,14,6,21,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,17-Nov,2021,16,11,10.1371/journal.pone.0256382,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256382,,,21,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Although wind power is a low-carbon source of energy, it can impact negatively birds and bats, either directly through fatality or indirectly by displacement or habitat loss. Pre-construction risk assessment at wind facilities within the United States is usually required only on public lands. When conducted, it generally involves a 3-tier process, with each step leading to more detailed and rigorous surveys. Preliminary site assessment (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Tier 1) is usually conducted remotely and involves evaluation of existing databases and published materials. If potentially at-risk wildlife are present and the developer wishes to continue the development process, then on-site surveys are conducted (Tier 2) to verify the presence of those species and to assess site-specific features (e.g., topography, land cover) that may influence risk from turbines. The next step in the process (Tier 3) involves quantitative or scientific studies to assess the potential risk of the proposed project to wildlife. Typical Tier-3 research may involve acoustic, aural, observational, radar, capture, tracking, or modeling studies, all designed to understand details of risk to specific species or groups of species at the given site. Our review highlights several features lacking from many risk assessments, particularly the paucity of before-and-after-control-impact (BACI) studies involving modeling and a lack of understanding of cumulative effects of wind facilities on wildlife.

Recent studies have reported large numbers of migratory tree-roosting bats being killed at utility-scale wind power facilities, especially in the eastern United States. We used thermal infrared (TIR) cameras to assess the flight behavior of bats at wind turbines because this technology makes it possible to observe the nocturnal behavior of bats and birds independently of supplemental light sources. We conducted this study at the Mountaineer Wind Energy Center in Tucker County, West Virginia, USA, where hundreds of migratory tree bats have been found injured or dead beneath wind turbines. We recorded nightly 9-hour sessions of TIR video of operating turbines from which we assessed altitude, direction, and types of flight maneuvers of bats, birds, and insects. We observed bats actively foraging near operating turbines, rather than simply passing through turbine sites. Our results indicate that bats 1) approached both rotating and nonrotating blades, 2) followed or were trapped in blade-tip vortices, 3) investigated the various parts of the turbine with repeated fly-bys, and 4) were struck directly by rotating blades. Blade rotational speed was a significant negative predictor of collisions with turbine blades, suggesting that bats may be at higher risk of fatality on nights with low wind speeds.",research,United States of America,37,120,124,14,192,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Thus, at a utility-scale wind facility in north-central Texas, we explored whether bat fatalities were higher at wind turbines with red flashing aviation lighting compared with turbines without such lighting. Over a 5-year period, we recorded fatalities at wind turbines as part of a long-term fatality monitoring programme. During standardized searches, we collected 916 bat carcasses representing all six species known to be present at the site. We found that bat fatalities were higher at wind turbines without aviation lighting compared with those with; a pattern that was driven by one species, Lasiurus borealis, and there was no significant difference between fatalities at wind turbines with or without aviation lighting for any other species. Our study demonstrates that wind turbines should continue to be fitted with synchronized, flashing red aviation lights, as this form of lighting does not appear to be one of the potential causes of bat fatalities at wind resource facilities.

One hypothesis is that bats would be attracted to turbines as a foraging resource if the insects that bats prey upon are commonly present on and around the turbine towers. To investigate the role that foraging activity may play in bat fatalities, we conducted a series of surveys at a wind farm in the southern Great Plains of the US from 2011-2016. From acoustic monitoring we recorded foraging activity, including feeding buzzes indicative of prey capture, in the immediate vicinity of turbine towers from all six bat species known to be present at this site. From insect surveys we found Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Orthoptera in consistently high proportions over several years suggesting that food resources for bats were consistently available at wind turbines. We used DNA bar coding techniques to assess bat diet composition of (1) stomach contents from 47 eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) and 24 hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) carcasses collected in fatality searches, and (2) fecal pellets from 23 eastern red bats that were found on turbine towers, transformers, and tower doors. We found that the majority of the eastern red bat and hoary bat stomachs, the two bat species most commonly found in fatality searches at this site, were full or partially full, indicating that the bats were likely killed while foraging. Although Lepidoptera and Orthoptera dominated the diets of these two bat species, both consumed a range of prey items with individual bats having from one to six insect species in their stomachs at the time of death. The prey items identified from eastern red bat fecal pellets showed similar results. A comparison of the turbine insect community to the diet analysis results revealed that the most abundant insects at wind turbines, including terrestrial insects such as crickets and several important crop pests, were also commonly eaten by eastern red and hoary bats. Collectively, these findings suggest that bats are actively foraging around wind turbines and that measures to minimize bat fatalities should be broadly implemented at wind facilities.",research,United States of America,59,21,23,6,107,PEERJ,PeerJ,3-Nov,2017,5,,10.7717/peerj.3985,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3985,,,23,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

We tested whether bat passage rates through rotor-swept airspace differ between groups of wind turbines where bat fatalities were found and not found during next-morning dog searches for fatalities. Passage rates differed significantly and averaged four times higher where freshly killed bats were found in next-morning fatality searches. Rates of near misses and risky flight behaviors also differed significantly between groups of turbines where bats were found and not found, and rate of near misses averaged eight times higher where bat fatalities were found in next-morning searches. Hours of turbine operation averaged significantly higher, winds averaged more westerly, and the moon averaged more visible among turbines where and when bat fatalities were found. Although dogs found only one of four bats seen colliding with turbine blades, they found many more bat fatalities than did human-only searchers at the same wind projects, and our fatality estimates were considerably higher. Our rates of observed bat collisions, adjusted for the rates of unseen collisions, would predict four to seven times the fresh fatalities we found using dogs between two wind projects. Despite markedly improved carcass detection through use of dogs, best estimates of bat fatalities might still be biased low due to crippling bias and search radius bias.",research,United States of America,41,7,7,1,12,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,FEB,2020,12,2,10.3390/d12020084,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d12020084,,,19,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

Many fatalities involve tree-roosting bats, but reasons for this higher susceptibility remain unknown. To better understand behaviors associated with risk, we monitored bats at three experimentally manipulated wind turbines in Indiana, United States, from July 29 to October 1, 2012, using thermal cameras and other methods. We observed bats on 993 occasions and saw many behaviors, including close approaches, flight loops and dives, hovering, and chases. Most bats altered course toward turbines during observation. Based on these new observations, we tested the hypotheses that wind speed and blade rotation speed influenced the way that bats interacted with turbines. We found that bats were detected more frequently at lower wind speeds and typically approached turbines on the leeward ( downwind) side. The proportion of leeward approaches increased with wind speed when blades were prevented from turning, yet decreased when blades could turn. Bats were observed more frequently at turbines on moonlit nights. Taken together, these observations suggest that bats may orient toward turbines by sensing air currents and using vision, and that air turbulence caused by fast-moving blades creates conditions that are less attractive to bats passing in close proximity. Tree bats may respond to streams of air flowing downwind from trees at night while searching for roosts, conspecifics, and nocturnal insect prey that could accumulate in such flows. Fatalities of tree bats at turbines may be the consequence of behaviors that evolved to provide selective advantages when elicited by tall trees, but are now maladaptive when elicited by wind turbines.",research,United States of America,53,117,119,3,166,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

One hypothesis is that bats are attracted to wind turbines and this attraction may be because bats perceive or misperceive the turbines to provide a resource, such as a foraging or roosting site. During postconstruction fatality searches at a wind energy facility in the southern Great Plains, U.S., we discovered bat feces near the base of a wind turbine tower, which led us to hypothesize that bats were actively roosting and/or foraging at turbines. Thus over 2 consecutive years, we conducted systematic searches for bat feces on turbines at this site. We collected 72 bat fecal samples from turbines and successfully extracted DNA from 56 samples. All 6 bat species known to be in the area were confirmed and the majority (59%) were identified as Lasiurus borealis; a species that also comprised the majority of the fatalities (60%) recorded at the site. The presence of bat feces provides further evidence that bats were conducting activities in close proximity to wind turbines. Moreover, feces found in areas such as turbine door slats indicated that bats were using turbines as night or foraging roosts, and further provided evidence that bats were active near the turbines. Future research should therefore aim to identify those features of wind turbines that bats perceive or misperceive as a resource, which in turn may lead to new minimization strategies that effectively reduce bat fatalities at wind farms.

Most bat fatalities at turbines thus far occur during late summer and autumn and involve species that roost in trees. In this commentary I draw on existing literature to illustrate how previous behavioral observations of the affected species might help explain these fatalities. I hypothesize that tree bats collide with turbines while engaging in mating behaviors that center on the tallest trees in a landscape, and that such behaviors stem from 2 different mating systems (resource defense polygyny and lekking). Bats use vision to move across landscapes and might react to the visual stimulus of turbines as they do to tall trees. This scenario has serious conservation and management implications. If mating bats are drawn to turbines, wind energy facilities may act as population sinks and risk may be hard to assess before turbines are built. Researchers could observe bat behavior and experimentally manipulate trees, turbines, or other tall structures to test the hypothesis that tree bats mate at the tallest trees. If this hypothesis is supported, management actions aimed at decreasing the attractiveness of turbines to tree bats may help alleviate the problem.",research,United States of America,58,75,79,2,67,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Carcass surveys at individual wind turbines vary from daily to once a week and from large cleared plots to only the road and pad area. A physics-based model is proposed to guide carcass surveys, for designing curtailment studies to detect treatment fatalities and for improving fatality estimates by accounting for unsearched areas. The model considers the effects of carcass size, weight, and drag, and it accounts for the turbine rotor size and rotation rate to simulate the trajectory of a carcass after it is struck by a wind turbine blade. A carcass parameter is defined as the ratio of drag force to body weight, which accounts for the relative effect of bat biophysical and aerodynamic characteristics. By applying restrictions on carcass survey and turbine yaw data, a limited sample of bat fatalities was obtained, and the analysis revealed that bats fall downwind of wind turbines, indicating wind drift significantly influences carcass fall trajectories. The new ballistics model includes the effect of wind drift on fall trajectory of a carcass. The model was used to investigate the sensitivity of carcass fall trajectories to variability of the input parameters. The tests showed that larger values of the carcass parameter, that is, when drag dominates, such as for small carcasses, resulted in larger downwind drift, whereas large carcasses with smaller carcass parameter values resulted in larger distances within the rotor plane. The relationship of wind speed and RPM was found to influence the carcass downwind distance more compared to the within rotor plane distance. Using carcass survey data, turbine operation data, and wind speed records, for seven bats surveyed the day after colliding with a wind turbine, modelled back-trajectories were used to identify the likely strike location on the rotor. The model can be improved by validating the modelled trajectories with the recorded bat-blade strikes in thermal videos. It should be noted that the findings of the present study are based on the bat fatalities that met strict criteria leading to small sample size and hence requires further evaluation for testing the robustness of the model.",research,United States of America,31,2,2,0,17,WIND ENERGY,Wind Energy,DEC,2021,24,12,10.1002/we.2638,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/we.2638,,21-Apr,19,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering

Industry stakeholders and regulatory agencies alike are investigating strategies to reduce risk of population-level consequences as the wind energy industry grows. Bats collide with turbines only when turbine rotors are spinning and curtailing turbine operation at low wind speeds can effectively reduce bat fatality rates. Nonetheless, few quantitative data exist to determine appropriate threshold wind speeds below which turbine operations should be curtailed. Carcass monitoring is labor-intensive and does not provide information on factors linked to bat fatality rates on any scale finer than nightly. We tested whether acoustic bat data recorded at turbine nacelles could provide a more precise and sensitive measure of fatality risk to bats by analyzing acoustics, weather, turbine operation, and carcass data collected at 2 commercial wind energy facilities in West Virginia over 7 years. Each wind facility implemented several distinct curtailment treatments during our study, allowing us to compare fatality rates and acoustic bat activity across multiple operational strategies. We found that bat passes exposed to turbine operation explained close to 80% of the variation in carcass-based estimates of bat fatality rates and accounted for significant variation in raw carcass counts per turbine and probability of finding bat carcasses during individual turbine searches. Conversely, bat activity occurring when turbines were not operating had little or no relationship to fatality rates. We also found that patterns in bat activity exposure could be predicted accurately among turbines and years. Our results demonstrate that measuring exposure of acoustic bat activity provides a quantitative basis for designing, evaluating, and adaptively managing curtailment strategies. This is an important advance towards using curtailment to reduce bat fatality rates strategically while allowing for increased generation of renewable energy. (c) 2021 The Authors.

However, population-level impacts are unknown as we lack basic demographic information about these species. We investigated whether fatalities at wind turbines could impact population viability of migratory bats, focusing on the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), the species most frequently killed by turbines in North America. Using expert elicitation and population projection models, we show that mortality from wind turbines may drastically reduce population size and increase the risk of extinction. For example, the hoary bat population could decline by as much as 90% in the next 50 years if the initial population size is near 2.5 million bats and annual population growth rate is similar to rates estimated for other bat species (lambda = 1.01).

Over 30 months of monitoring the same wind turbines, April 2012-October 2014, searches averaging 5-day intervals detected 308 additional fatalities (of 431 fatalities total) representing 20 additional species (of 32 species total) compared with the searches averaging 39-day intervals. Body mass explained most of the variation in discrepant fatality detections between the 2 search intervals, with the 39-day interval searches detecting only 10% of the bats and birds of 10-40 g that were found by the 5-day interval searches. The 39-day search interval produced an estimate of annual bird fatalities/MW that was 39% lower than the estimate produced from the 5-day search interval. The 39-day search interval also resulted in many more species identification errors and greater errors in estimated time since death. The average search interval used in fatality monitoring strongly influences fatality estimates; long intervals can contribute to false impressions that wind projects have small or negligible effects on small birds and bats.

Most of the bats killed by turbines thus far have been migratory species that roost in trees throughout the year, and the highest fatality events appear to coincide with autumn migration. Hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) are highly migratory and one of the most frequently killed species at wind turbines. We analyzed a long-term data set to investigate how weather and moonlight influenced the occurrence of hoary bats at an island stopover point along their migration route. We then related our results to the problem of bat fatalities at wind turbines. We found that relatively low wind speeds, low moon illumination, and relatively high degrees of cloud cover were important predictors of bat arrivals and departures, and that low barometric pressure was an additional variable that helped predict arrivals. Slight differences in the conditions under which bats arrived and departed from the island suggest that hoary bats may be more likely to arrive on the island with passing storm fronts in autumn. These results also indicate that fatalities of hoary bats at wind turbines may be predictable events, that the species may be drawn to prominent landmarks that they see during migration, and that they regularly migrate over the ocean. Additional observations from this and other studies suggest that the problem of bat fatalities at wind turbines may be associated with flocking and autumn mating behaviors.

Accordingly, strategies to improve compatibility between wind energy development and conservation of bat populations are needed. We combined results of continuous echolocation and meteorological monitoring at multiple stations to model conditions that explained presence of LowF bats at a wind energy facility in southern California. We used a site occupancy approach to model nightly LowF bat presence while accounting for variation in detection probability among echolocation detectors and heights. However, we transposed the spatial and temporal axes of the conventional detection history matrix such that occupancy represented proportion of nights, rather than monitoring points, on which LowF bats were detected. Detectors at 22?m and 52?m above ground had greater detection probabilities for LowF bats than detectors at 2?m above ground. Occupancy of LowF bats was associated with lower nightly wind speeds and higher nightly temperatures, mirroring results from other wind energy facilities. Nevertheless, we found that building separate models for each season and considering solutions with multiple covariates resulted in better fitting models. We suggest that use of multiple environmental variables to predict bat presence could improve efficiency of turbine operational mitigations (e.g., changes to cut-in speeds) over those based solely on wind speed. Increased mitigation efficiencies could lead to greater use of mitigations at wind energy facilities with benefits to bat populations.

One hypothesis is that bats come into close proximity to turbines due to existing resources (e.g., roosting sites) in the immediate area. Thus, if resource hotspots for bats could be identified in areas proposed for wind energy development, then fatalities could be reduced by siting turbines away from such hotspots. To explore this, we conducted a resource mapping exercise at a 48 km(2) wind energy facility in north-central Texas. We mapped known resources (such as water sources, roosting sites, foraging sites, and commuting routes) for the 6 bat species present and compared resource availability with observed fatalities and acoustic activity. Although resource mapping identified concentrations of known resources for all species, it did not predict bat activity or fatalities. For example, Lasiurus cinereus and Lasiurus borealis comprised >90% of the fatalities, yet we found no positive relationship between resource availability and fatalities or acoustic activity for either species. Furthermore, up to 33% of these fatalities occurred at turbines without known resources within 200 m of the turbines, demonstrating that the fine-scale distribution of resources may not effectively inform turbine siting for these two migratory species. The challenge, therefore, remains to determine why bats during the migratory season are coming in close proximity with wind turbines.",research,United States of America,60,4,4,0,10,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,JUN,2018,10,2,10.3390/d10020044,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d10020044,,,19,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

An assumed linear increase of fatalities with installed capacity would expand my estimate of bat fatalities across the USA from 0.89 million in 2012 to 1.11 million in 2014 and to 1.72 million in 2019. However, this assumed linear relationship could have been invalidated by shifts in turbine size, tower height, fatality search interval during monitoring, and regional variation in bat fatalities. I tested for effects of these factors in fatality monitoring reports through 2014. I found no significant relationship between bat fatality rates and wind turbine size. Bat fatality rates increased with increasing tower height, but this increase mirrored the increase in fatality rates with shortened fatality search intervals that accompanied the increase in tower heights. Regional weighting of mean project-level bat fatalities increased the national-level estimate 17% to 1.3 (95% CI: 0.15-3.0) million. After I restricted the estimate's basis to project-level fatality rates that were estimated from fatality search intervals <10 days, my estimate increased by another 71% to 2.22 (95% CI: 1.77-2.72) million bat fatalities in the USA's lower 48 states in 2014.

We conducted a formal blinded trial comparing the abilities of search dogs and human observers to locate bat carcasses. Dogs located 73% (46/63) of bats, whereas humans found 20% (12/60). We therefore recommend search dogs as an effective means of monitoring bat fatalities, particularly when a high degree of search accuracy is important. This includes surveys for rare species, or cases where searches are limited in extent or duration, because the application of correction factors is problematic where very few or no casualties are found. The dogs averaged 40 min to complete a survey, which was <25% of the time taken by humans. At large sites, the high initial set-up costs for search dogs can therefore be offset by the increased number of surveys that can be conducted within a given time. However, care must be taken with the selection and training of the dogs and handlers to produce consistent results. To allow fatality rates to be estimated from the number of casualties located, it is essential that assessments of the accuracy of the dog-handler team are made at each site.

Factors influencing bat susceptibility to wind turbines might be revealed by temporal patterns in their behaviors around these dynamic landscape structures. In northern temperate zones, fatalities occur mostly from July through October, but whether this reflects seasonally variable behaviors, passage of migrants, or some combination of factors remains unknown. In this study, we examined video imagery spanning one year in the state of Colorado in the United States, to characterize patterns of seasonal and nightly variability in bat behavior at a wind turbine. We detected bats on 177 of 306 nights representing approximately 3,800 hr of video and > 2,000 discrete bat events. We observed bats approaching the turbine throughout the night across all months during which bats were observed. Two distinct seasonal peaks of bat activity occurred in July and September, representing 30% and 42% increases in discrete bat events from the preceding months June and August, respectively. Bats exhibited behaviors around the turbine that increased in both diversity and duration in July and September. The peaks in bat events were reflected in chasing and turbine approach behaviors. Many of the bat events involved multiple approaches to the turbine, including when bats were displaced through the air by moving blades. The seasonal and nightly patterns we observed were consistent with the possibility that wind turbines invoke investigative behaviors in bats in late summer and autumn coincident with migration and that bats may return and fly close to wind turbines even after experiencing potentially disruptive stimuli like moving blades. Our results point to the need for a deeper understanding of the seasonality, drivers, and characteristics of bat movement across spatial scales.",research,United States of America,48,4,4,3,15,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

One theory that explains the mortality is that bats are not only killed by impact trauma, but also by barotrauma that results from exposure to the pressure variations caused by rotating turbine blades. To date, no published research has calculated the pressure changes that bats may be exposed to when flying near wind turbines and then used these data to estimate the likelihood that turbines cause barotrauma in bats. To address this shortcoming, we performed computational fluid dynamics simulations of a wind turbine and analytical calculations of blade-tip vortices to estimate the characteristics of the sudden pressure changes bats may experience when flying near a utility-scale wind turbine. Because there are no data available that characterize the pressure changes that cause barotrauma in bats, we compared our results to changes in pressure levels that cause barotrauma and mortality in other mammals of similar size. This comparison shows that the magnitude of the low-pressures bats experience when flying near wind turbines is approximately 8 times smaller than the pressure that causes mortality in rats, the smallest mammal for which data are available. The magnitude of the high-pressures that bats may experience are approximately 80 times smaller than the exposure level that causes 50% mortality in mice, which have a body mass similar to several bat species that are killed by wind turbines. Further, our results show that for a bat to experience the largest possible magnitude of low- and high-pressures, they must take very specific and improbable flight paths that skim the surface of the blades. Even a small change in the flight path results in the bat being hit by the blade or experiencing a much smaller pressure change. Accordingly, if bats have a physiological response to rapid low- and high-pressure exposure that is similar to other mammals, we conclude that it is unlikely that barotrauma is responsible for a significant number of turbine-related bat fatalities, and that impact trauma is the likely cause of the majority of wind-turbine-related bat fatalities.",research,United States of America,57,5,5,2,12,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,31-Dec,2020,15,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0242485,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242485,,,24,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

In eastern North America, where mortality rates are among the highest in the world, the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) and the eastern red bat (L. borealis) comprise the majority of turbine-associated bat mortality. Both species are migratory tree bats with widespread distributions; however, little is known regarding the geographic origins of bats killed at wind-energy facilities or the diversity and population structure of affected species. We addressed these unknowns by measuring stable hydrogen isotope ratios (delta H-2) and conducting population genetic analyses of bats killed at wind-energy facilities in the central Appalachian Mountains (USA) to determine the summering origins, effective size, structure, and temporal stability of populations. Our results indicate that similar to 1% of hoary bat mortalities and similar to 57% of red bat mortalities derive from non-local sources, with no relationship between the proportion of non-local bats and sex, location of mortality, or month of mortality. Additionally, our data indicate that hoary bats in our sample consist of an unstructured population with a small effective size (N-e) and either a stable or declining history. Red bats also showed no evidence of population genetic structure, but in contrast to hoary bats, the diversity contained in our red bat samples is consistent with a much larger N-e that reflects a demographic expansion after a bottleneck. These results suggest that the impacts of mortality associated with intensive wind-energy development may affect bat species dissimilarly, with red bats potentially better able to absorb sustained mortality than hoary bats because of their larger N-e. Our results provide important baseline data and also illustrate the utility of stable isotopes and population genetics for monitoring bat populations affected by wind-energy development.",research,United States of America,80,25,25,1,89,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Collision of birds and bats with turbines in utility-scale wind farms is an increasing cause of concern. 2. Carcass counts conducted to quantify the take' of protected species need to be corrected for carcass persistence probability (removal by scavengers and decay) and detection probability (searcher efficiency). These probabilities may vary with time since death, because of intrinsic changes in carcass properties with age and of heterogeneity (preferential removal of easy-to-detect carcasses). 3. In this article, we describe the use of superpopulation capture-recapture models to perform the required corrections to the raw count data. We review how to make such models age specific and how to combine trial experiments with carcass searches in order to accommodate the fact that carcasses are stationary (which affects the detection process). 4. We derive information about optimal sampling design (proportion of the turbines to sample, number of sampling occasions, interval between sampling occasions) and use simulations to illustrate the expected precision of mortality estimates. We analyse data from a small wind farm in New Jersey, in which we find the estimated number of fatalities to be twice the number of carcasses found. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our approach to estimation of wind farm mortality based on data from carcass surveys is flexible and can accommodate a range of different sampling designs and biological hypotheses.

These bats have been shown to be highly susceptible to collisions with wind energy turbines and are known to fly offshore during migration. Therefore, as offshore wind energy expands off the eastern U.S. coast, there is some concern about potential impacts. We monitored bats in coastal Virginia, USA, using acoustic monitors-devices that collect the unique echolocation call signatures of bat species. We found that nightly tree bat visitation offshore or on barrier islands was associated with wind speed, temperature, visibility, and seasonality. Using statistical modeling, we developed a predictive tool to assess occurrence probabilities at varying levels of wind speed, temperature, and seasonality. Probability of occurrence and therefore assumed risk to collision is highest on high temperature and visibility nights, low wind speed nights, and during the spring and fall seasons. We suggest a similar modeling regime could be used to predict the occurrence of bats at offshore wind sites to inform potential mitigation efforts. In eastern North America, tree bats (Genera: Lasiurus and Lasionycteris) are highly susceptible to collisions with wind energy turbines and are known to fly offshore during migration. This raises concern about ongoing expansion of offshore wind-energy development off the Atlantic Coast. Season, atmospheric conditions, and site-level characteristics such as local habitat (e.g., forest coverage) have been shown to influence wind turbine collision rates by bats onshore, and therefore may be related to risk offshore. Therefore, to assess the factors affecting coastal presence of bats, we continuously gathered tree bat occurrence data using stationary acoustic recorders on five structures (four lighthouses on barrier islands and one light tower offshore) off the coast of Virginia, USA, across all seasons, 2012-2019. We used generalized additive models to describe tree bat occurrence on a nightly basis. We found that sites either indicated maternity or migratory seasonal occurrence patterns associated with local roosting resources, i.e., presence of trees. Across all sites, nightly occurrence was negatively related to wind speed and positively related to temperature and visibility. Using predictive performance metrics, we concluded that our model was highly predictive for the Virginia coast. Our findings were consistent with other studies-tree bat occurrence probability and presumed mortality risk to offshore wind-energy collisions is highest on low wind speed nights, high temperature and visibility nights, and during spring and fall. The high predictive model performance we observed provides a basis for which managers, using a similar monitoring and modeling regime, could develop an effective curtailment-based mitigation strategy.",research,United States of America,95,4,4,4,7,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,NOV,2021,11,11,10.3390/ani11113146,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11113146,,,18,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology
J,"Prakash, S; Markfort, CD",Experimental investigation of aerodynamic characteristics of bat carcasses after collision with a wind turbine,WIND ENERGY SCIENCE,English,Article,,ENERGY DEVELOPMENT; DRAG COEFFICIENT; BIRD; MORTALITY; AREAS,"A large number of bat fatalities have been reported in wind energy facilities in different regions globally. Wind farm operators are required to monitor bat fatalities by conducting carcass surveys at wind farms. A previous study implemented the ballistics model to characterize the carcass fall zone distributions after a bat is struck by turbine blades. The ballistics model considers the aerodynamic drag force term, which is dependent upon the carcass drag coefficient. The bat carcass drag coefficient is highly uncertain; no measurement of it is available. This paper introduces a methodology for bat carcass drag coefficient estimation. Field investigation at Macksburg wind farm resulted in the discovery of three bat species: the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), and evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis). Carcass drop experiments were performed from a dropping platform at finite height, and carcass position time series data were recorded using a high-speed camera. Falling carcasses were subjected to aerodynamic drag and gravitational forces. Carcasses were observed to undergo rotation, often rotating around multiple axes simultaneously, as well as lateral translation. The complex fall dynamics, along with drop from a limited height, prohibit the carcasses from attaining terminal velocity. Under this limitation, the drag coefficient is estimated by fitting a ballistics model to the measured velocity. Multivariable optimization was performed to fit the ballistics model to the measured velocity resulting, in an optimized estimate of the drag coefficient. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated significant variation in the drag coefficient with a small change in initial position, highlighting the chaotic nature of carcass fall dynamics Based on the limited sample, the bat carcass drag coefficient and terminal velocity were found to be between 0.70-1.23 and 6.63-17.57 m s(-1), respectively. The maximum distance carcasses are predicted to fall after impact with a typical utility-scale onshore wind turbine was computed using a 2-D ballistics model. Based on the range of drag coefficients found in this study, hoary and evening bats are estimated to fall within the rotor plane up to a maximum distance of 92 and 62 m, respectively, from the wind turbine tower. The ballistics model of carcasses after being struck by wind turbine blades can be used to obtain fall distributions for bats, guide carcass survey efforts, and correct survey data for limited or unsearched areas.",research,United States of America,33,4,4,1,11,WIND ENERGY SCI,Wind Energy Sci.,16-Jun,2020,5,2,10.5194/wes-5-745-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/wes-5-745-2020,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics

One of the hypothesized causes of bat susceptibility is that bats are attracted to insects on or near the turbines. We examined insect remains in the stomachs and intestines of hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) found dead beneath wind turbines in New York and Texas to evaluate the hypothesis that bats die while feeding at turbines. Most of the bats we examined had full stomachs, indicating that they fed in the minutes to hours leading up to their deaths. However, we did not find prey in the mouths or throats of any bats that would indicate the bats died while capturing prey. Hoary bats fed mostly on moths, but we also detected the regular presence of beetles, true bugs, and crickets. Presence of terrestrial insects in stomachs indicates that bats may have gleaned them from the ground or the turbine surfaces, yet aerial capture of winged insect stages cannot be ruled out. Our findings confirm earlier studies that indicate hoary bats feed during migration and eat mostly moths. Future studies on bat behaviors and insect presence at wind turbines could help determine whether feeding at turbines is a major fatality risk for bats.",research,United States of America,44,21,21,3,67,WEST N AM NATURALIST,West.

During May-Jul. 2004 and 2005, we studied bird and bat mortality from collisions with wind turbines at a 102 megawatt, 68-turbine wind farm in the southern Great Plains, Oklahoma, USA. Standardized searches around turbine bases yielded 122 total carcasses of which 92 (75%) were found within 20 m of the turbine bases. We identified 111 carcasses of seven species of bats and 11 carcasses of 6 species of birds. Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) comprised 85% of bat carcasses collected. We corrected turbine collision estimates using searcher efficiency trials and a range of removal (i.e., scavenging) rates reported in the literature. Estimated bat turbine collisions ranged from 1.19-1.71 fatalities/turbine (1.03-1.37/megawatt). These data provide some of the first evidence for a steady rate of collision mortality of Brazilian free-tailed bats at a North American wind farm, most likely due to the site's proximity (similar to 15 km) to a maternity colony. Spatial analyses indicated no consistent pattern in mortality estimates relative to ground cover or topographic position; but collision mortality was higher at several individual turbines, all of which were located near the heads of eroded ravines.",research,United States of America,46,33,37,1,60,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

The aim of this study was to better understand the details and timing of reproductive events in species of bats that die most frequently at wind turbines in North America, because such information can help inform conservation strategies. We examined the reproductive anatomy of hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), eastern red bats (L. borealis), and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) found dead beneath industrial-scale wind turbines to learn more about when they mate. We evaluated 103 L. cinereus, 18 L. borealis, and 47 Ln. noctivagans from wind energy facilities in the United States and Canada. Histological analysis revealed that most male L. cinereus and L. borealis, as well as over half the Ln. noctivagans examined had sperm in the caudae epididymides by late August, indicating readiness to mate. Testes regression in male hoary bats coincided with enlargement of seminal vesicles and apparent growth of keratinized spines on the glans penis. Seasonality of these processes also suggests that mating could occur during August in L. cinereus. Spermatozoa were found in the uterus of an adult female hoary bat collected in September, but not in any other females. Ovaries of all females sampled had growing secondary or tertiary follicles, indicating sexual maturity even in first-year females. Lasiurus cinereus, L. borealis, and Ln. noctivagans are the only North American temperate bats in which most first-year young of both sexes are known to sexually mature in their first autumn.

Species-wide effects are difficult to study and few, if any, studies examine effects of wind energy generation on any species across its entire range. One species that may be affected by wind energy generation is the endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), which is found in the eastern and midwestern United States. In addition to mortality from wind energy generation, the species also faces range-wide threats from the emerging infectious fungal disease, white-nose syndrome (WNS). White-nose syndrome, caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans, disturbs hibernating bats leading to high levels of mortality. We used a spatially explicit full-annual-cycle model to investigate how wind turbine mortality and WNS may singly and then together affect population dynamics of this species. In the simulation, wind turbine mortality impacted the metapopulation dynamics of the species by causing extirpation of some of the smaller winter colonies. In general, effects of wind turbines were localized and focused on specific spatial subpopulations. Conversely, WNS had a depressive effect on the species across its range. Wind turbine mortality interacted with WNS and together these stressors had a larger impact than would be expected from either alone, principally because these stressors together act to reduce species abundance across the spectrum of population sizes. Our findings illustrate the importance of not only prioritizing the protection of large winter colonies as is currently done, but also of protecting metapopulation dynamics and migratory connectivity.",research,United States of America,79,21,21,0,68,PEERJ,PeerJ,22-Dec,2016,4,,10.7717/peerj.2830,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2830,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Using reference mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene sequences mined from GENBANK and new sequences from collected samples, we constructed maximum likelihood trees including all 47 bat species found in the USA and tested the use of this locus for DNA barcoding these bat species. In this study, 80 % of species examined had distinct barcodes, including species currently listed as threatened or endangered. Nine of 17 Myotis bat species examined did not form distinct clades and had very low inter-specific genetic distances (1.4 %), thereby making this barcoding technique unreliable for some members of this genus. We then applied this technique to DNA samples from 892 bats salvaged from wind farms across four states. Using DNA barcoding, we were able to identify 14 carcasses to species that could not be identified in the field due to extensive decomposition and scavenging, and determined that another 18 carcasses had been misidentified in the field. Furthermore, we found field misidentifications increased with time until discovery. We conclude that DNA barcoding can improve the identification of salvaged bat carcasses especially when rare and uncommon species are encountered. This technique has other practical applications, such as identifying remains from hibernacula (potentially including carcasses of unknown bats with white-nose syndrome) or identifying species from fecal samples at roost sites or other locales.",research,United States of America,28,14,14,1,29,CONSERV GENET RESOUR,Conserv.

Using data pooled from 114 post-construction monitoring studies conducted at wind facilities across the United States, we described seasonal patterns of fatalities among birds and bats. Bat fatalities peaked in the fall. Silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans), a long-distance migrant, and Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) both showed maximum fatality counts later in the year-October and November, respectively-than any other bat species. The other common species in our sample-hoary bat (Aeorestes cinereus), Eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), and big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus)-showed broadly overlapping peaks of fatality counts in August. Fatalities of silver-haired bat showed a smaller spring peak in some ecoregions; no other bat species exhibited this pattern. Seasonal patterns of bird fatalities varied among guilds. Woodland birds, many of which were long-distance migrants, showed two peaks in fatalities corresponding to spring and fall migration. Grassland birds and soaring birds, most of which were resident or short-distance migrants, did not exhibit strong seasonal peaks in fatalities. Species in these guilds tend to inhabit regions with extensive wind-energy development year-round, which may explain the more consistent numbers of fatalities that we observed. Our results highlight the value of pooling data to develop science-based solutions to reduce conflicts between wind-energy development and wildlife but also emphasize the need for more extensive data and standardization of post-construction monitoring to support more robust inferences regarding wind-wildlife interactions and collision risk.",research,United States of America,26,0,0,6,6,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,10-May,2023,18,5,10.1371/journal.pone.0284778,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284778,,,17,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Researchers and managers have made major efforts to chronicle bird and bat mortality associated with wind facilities, but few studies have examined the patterns and underlying mechanisms of spatial patterns of fatalities at wind facilities. Understanding the horizontal fall distance between a carcass and the nearest turbine pole is important in designing effective search protocols and estimating total mortality. We explored patterns in taxonomic composition and fall distance of bird and bat carcasses at wind facilities in the Northeastern United States using publicly available data and data submitted to the US Fish and Wildlife Service under scientific collecting and special purpose utility permits for collection and study of migratory birds. Forty-four wind facilities reported 2,039 bird fatalities spanning 128 species and 22 facilities reported 418 bat fatalities spanning five species. Relative to long-distance migratory birds, short-distance migrants were found farther from turbines. Body mass of birds and bats positively influenced fall distance. Turbine size positively influenced fall distance of birds and bats when analyzed collectively and of birds when analyzed separately from bats. This suggests that as turbines increase in size, a greater search radius will be necessary to detect carcasses. Bird and bat fall distance distributions were notably multimodal, but only birds exhibited a high peak near turbine bases, a novel finding we attribute to collisions with turbine poles in addition to blades. This phenomenon varied across bird species, with potential implications for the accuracy of mortality estimates. Although pole collisions for birds is intuitive, this phenomenon has not been formally recognized. This finding may warrant an updated view of turbines as a collision threat to birds because they are a tall structure, and not strictly as a function of their motion.",research,United States of America,97,9,9,2,32,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,28-Aug,2020,15,8,10.1371/journal.pone.0238034,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238034,,,22,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

The authors evaluated competing hypotheses of barotrauma and traumatic injury to determine the cause. They first examined the utility of lungs from salvaged bat carcasses for histopathologic diagnosis of barotrauma and studied laboratory mice as a model system. Postmortem time, environmental temperature, and freezing of carcasses all affected the development of vascular congestion, hemorrhage, and edema. These common tissue artifacts mimicked the diagnostic criteria of pulmonary barotrauma; therefore, lung tissues from salvaged bats should not be used for barotrauma diagnosis. The authors next compared wind farm (WF) bats to building collision (BC) bats collected near downtown Chicago buildings. WF bats had an increased incidence in fracture cases and specific bone fractures and had more external lacerations than BC bats. WF bats had additional features of traumatic injury, including diaphragmatic hernia, subcutaneous hemorrhage, and bone marrow emboli. In summary, 73% (190 of 262) of WF bats had lesions consistent with traumatic injury. The authors then examined for ruptured tympana, a sensitive marker of barotrauma in humans. BC bats had only 1 case (2%, 1 of 42), but this was attributed to concurrent cranial fractures, whereas WF bats had a 20% (16 of 81) incidence. When cases with concurrent traumatic injury were excluded, this yielded a small fraction (6%, 5 of 81) of WF bats with lesions possibly consistent with barotrauma etiology. Forensic pathology examination of the data strongly suggests that traumatic injury is the major cause of bat mortality at wind farms and, at best, barotrauma is a minor etiology.",research,United States of America,42,43,48,0,100,VET PATHOL,Vet.

However, accurate bat fatality estimates are unavailable for many facilities and regions due to lack of physically consistent guidance for surveying bat carcasses. We develop a Monte-Carlo based 3-D ballistics model to address this important gap to guide carcass surveys, help improve fatality estimates by combining it with statistical models and offer postconstruction impact assessment guidelines. Monte-Carlo simulations account for variability of environmentally relevant parameters and subsequently the variability of the generated carcass fall zone distributions. The input parameters are bat characteristics, including mass, size, and drag coefficient, wind speed, turbine RPM, yaw, bat flight speed, bat strike angle, and bat strike locations on the rotor. Using turbine SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), bat biometrics data, and carcass drag coefficient range, probability density functions of the input parameters were computed. With the help of carcass survey and SCADA details, bat fatalities were selected, and Monte-Carlo based ballistics model simulations were performed using corresponding values of the input parameters of the ballistics model. The surveyed carcass location for a bat found on the same day was in good agreement with the modelled fall zone distribution, providing a measure of model validation. Next, simulations were conducted for a bat fatality for which the carcass was found four days after collision. It was found that the observed location was within the modeled fall zone distribution showing the model capacity for planning surveys. Further, Monte-Carlo based 3-D ballistics model simulations were performed for the full migration season and the resulting 1-D (radial) and 2-D (surface) histograms were compared with the survey 1-D and 2-D histograms, respectively. The modelled 2-D fall zone distribution hot spot overlaps with surveyed carcass positions indicating the model robustness over a wide range of meteorological conditions and time scales. However, by comparison, the modeled 1-D fall zone distribution was found to be different from the surveyed 1-D fall zone distribution. We hypothesize that uncertainty in bat radial strike location (distribution of bat collisions on turbine blades in radial direction) distribution is primary source of difference between the surveyed and modelled 1D fall zone distribution. There are no measurements available for this key input parameter. As a next step, the sensitivity of carcass fall zone distributions with respect to bat radial strike location distributions were tested. It was found that the probability density function for bat radial strike location affects the modelled fall zone distributions significantly. There is a need to measure bat radial and angular strike locations which can be used as input in the ballistics modeling framework to improve prediction of carcass fall zone distributions. The proposed model is useful for carcass survey planning, improving survey estimates, designing turbine curtailment studies, and collision risk modeling.",research,United States of America,39,0,0,0,6,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

We recorded five species, including eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans). Seasonal bat activity (number of bat passes recorded) followed a cosine function and gradually increased beginning in April, peaked in August, and declined gradually until cessation in December. Based on autoregressive models, inter-night bat activity was autocorrelated for lags of seven nights or fewer but varied among acoustic monitoring stations. Higher nightly temperatures and lower wind speeds positively affected bat activity. When autoregressive model predictions were fitted to the observed nightly bat pass totals, model residuals > 2 standard deviations from the mean existed only during migration periods, indicating that periodic increases in bat activity could not be accounted for by seasonal trends and weather variables alone. Rather, the additional bat passes were attributable to migrating bats.

A key question that could guide bat-related management activities is identifying the geographic origin of bats killed at wind-energy facilities. Generating this information requires developing new methods for identifying the geographic sources of individual bats. Here we explore the viability of assigning geographic origin using trace element analyses of fur to infer the summer molting location of eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis). Our approach is based on the idea that the concentration of trace elements in bat fur is related through the food chain to the amount of trace elements present in the soil, which varies across large geographic scales. Specifically, we used inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to determine the concentration of fourteen trace elements in fur of 126 known-origin eastern red bats to generate a basemap for assignment throughout the range of this species in eastern North America. We then compared this map to publicly available soil trace element concentrations for the U.S. and Canada, used a probabilistic framework to generate likelihood-of-origin maps for each bat, and assessed how well trace element profiles predicted the origins of these individuals. Overall, our results suggest that trace elements allow successful assignment of individual bats 80% of the time while reducing probable locations in half.

Here, we utilize genetic data from eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), one of the species most highly affected by wind power development in North America, to (1) evaluate patterns of population structure across the landscape, (2) estimate effective population size (Ne), and (3) assess signals of growth or decline in population size. Using data on both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA variation, we demonstrate that this species forms a single, panmictic population across their range with no evidence for the historical use of divergent migratory pathways by any portion of the population. Further, using coalescent estimates we estimate that the effective size of this population is in the hundreds of thousands to millions of individuals.

This region also has high wind energy potential, but the effects of wind energy developments on migratory and resident bird and bat populations in the NGP remains understudied.

Waterfowl spring (Mar-Jun) fatality rates were 0.79 (SE=0.11) and 0.91 (SE=0.10) deaths/MW at TAWF and EKWF, respectively. Our results suggest that future wind facility siting decisions consider avoiding grassland habitats and locate turbines in pre-existing fragmented and converted habitat outside of high densities of breeding waterfowl and major migration corridors.

While an increase in aerial insectivore activity in the vicinity resulting from insect attraction to turbines remains a strong possibility, little research exists on the possible causes for such events. In this paper, the relative attraction of a selection of specific turbine colours and other hues is assessed in order to determine if turbine paint colour could be influencing insect numbers at these installations. The common turbine colours 'pure white' (RAL 9010) and 'light grey' (RAL 7035) were among those found to attract significantly more insects than other colours tested, suggesting colour may well have a role to play in potential mitigation.",research,United States of America,26,37,43,2,95,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

Given that wind power development is the fastest growing energy sector in the world, there is an immediate need to develop survey protocols that can reliably assess the potential risk of future wind power development on both resident and migratory bat populations. I surveyed the Maple Ridge Wind Project site in New York, USA, during the spring migratory season and summer reproductive season using acoustic monitoring and mist net capture techniques. Bat activity was low across the project site during the summer months. The bats I observed at the site flew near the tree canopy, well below turbine height. Acoustic survey data collected during the spring migratory season suggests migratory behavior is highly episodic, being higher on warmer days with lower wind speeds. Knowledge of the influence of meteorological conditions on bat migration will require data on the spatial and temporal components of this behavior. Although acoustic monitoring using vertical acoustic arrays is currently limited to measuring the risk of bat mortality at wind development sites, it may be a valuable tool to increase our knowledge of the migratory phenology of bats.",research,United States of America,68,37,38,0,34,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

To examine hourly migratory bat activity patterns in the fall and spring in Virginia in an exploratory fashion with a suite of general temporal, environmental, and weather variables, we acoustically monitored bat activity on five ridgelines and side slopes from early September through mid-November 2015 and 2016 and from early March through late April 2016 and 2017. On ridges, bat activity decreased through the autumn sample period, but was more variable through the spring sample period. In autumn, migratory bat activity had largely ceased by mid-November. Activity patterns were species specific in both autumn and spring sample periods. Generally, migratory bat activity was negatively associated with hourly wind speeds but positively associated with ambient temperatures.

Mexican free-tailed bats have declined due to historic guano mining, roost destruction, and bioaccumulation of organochlorine pesticides. Long-distance migrations and dense congregations at roosts exacerbate these declines. Wind energy development further threatens bat communities worldwide and presents emerging challenges to bat conservation. Effective mitigation of bat mortality at wind energy facilities requires baseline data on the biology of affected populations. We collected data on age, sex, and reproductive condition of Mexican free-tailed bats at a cave roost in eastern Nevada located 6 km from a 152-MW industrial wind energy facility. Over 5 years, we captured 46,353 Mexican free-tailed bats. Although just over half of the caught individuals were nonreproductive adult males (53.6%), 826 pregnant, 892 lactating, 10,101 post-lactating, and 4327 nonreproductive adult females were captured. Juveniles comprised 11.5% of captures. Female reproductive phenology was delayed relative to conspecific roosts at lower latitudes, likely due to cooler temperatures. Roost use by reproductive females and juvenile bats demonstrates this site is a maternity roost, with significant ecological and conservation value. To our knowledge, no other industrial scale wind energy facilities exist in such proximity to a heavily used bat roost in North America. Given the susceptibility of Mexican free-tailed bats to wind turbine mortality and the proximity of this roost to a wind energy facility, these data provide a foundation from which differential impacts on demographic groups can be assessed.",research,United States of America,69,0,0,3,11,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

However, scavenger trials typically place 10 carcasses at once within small areas* already supplying scavengers with carcasses deposited by wind turbines, so scavengers may be unable to process and remove all placed carcasses. To avoid scavenger swamping, which might bias fatality estimates low, we placed only 1-5 bird carcasses at a time amongst 52 wind turbines in our 249.7-ha study area, each carcass monitored by a motion-activated camera. Scavengers removed 50 of 63 carcasses, averaging 4.45 days to the first scavenging event. By 15 days, which corresponded with most of our search intervals, scavengers removed 0% and 67% of large-bodied raptors placed in winter and summer, respectively, and 15% and 71% of small birds placed in winter and summer, respectively. By 15 days, scavengers removed 42% of large raptors as compared to 15% removed in conventional trials, and scavengers removed 62% of small birds as compared to 52% removed in conventional trials. Based on our methodology, we estimated mean annual fatalities caused by 21.9 MW of wind turbines in Vasco Caves Regional Preserve (within Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area, California, USA) were 13 red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), 12 barn owls (Tyto alba), 18 burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia), 48 total raptors, and 99 total birds. Compared to fatality rates estimated from conventional scavenger trials, our estimates were nearly 3 times higher for red-tailed hawk and barn owl, 68% higher for all raptors, and 67% higher for all birds. We also found that deaths/gigawatt-hour of power generation declined quickly with increasing capacity factor among wind turbines, indicating collision hazard increased with greater intermittency in turbine operations. Fatality monitoring at wind turbines might improve by using scavenger removal trials free of scavenger swamping and by relating fatality rates to power output data in addition to rated capacity (i.e., turbine size). The resulting greater precision in mortality estimates will assist wildlife managers to assess wind farm impacts and to more accurately measure the effects of mitigation measures implemented to lessen those impacts.",research,United States of America,10,68,70,1,107,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

North American hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus cinereus) roost in trees year-round and probably migrate farther than any other bats, yet we still lack basic information about their migration patterns and wintering locations or strategies. This information is needed to better understand unprecedented fatality of hoary bats at wind turbines during autumn migration and to determine whether the species could be susceptible to an emerging disease affecting hibernating bats. Our aim was to infer probable seasonal movements of individual hoary bats to better understand their migration and seasonal distribution in North America. We analyzed the stable isotope values of non-exchangeable hydrogen in the keratin of bat hair and combined isotopic results with prior distributional information to derive relative probability density surfaces for the geographic origins of individuals. We then mapped probable directions and distances of seasonal movement. Results indicate that hoary bats summer across broad areas. In addition to assumed latitudinal migration, we uncovered evidence of longitudinal movement by hoary bats from inland summering grounds to coastal regions during autumn and winter. Coastal regions with nonfreezing temperatures may be important wintering areas for hoary bats. Hoary bats migrating through any particular area, such as a wind turbine facility in autumn, are likely to have originated from a broad expanse of summering grounds from which they have traveled in no recognizable order. Better characterizing migration patterns and wintering behaviors of hoary bats sheds light on the evolution of migration and provides context for conserving these migrants.",research,United States of America,102,56,58,0,77,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Estimation typically involves counting carcasses observed below turbines and adjusting counts by estimated detection probabilities. Three primary sources of imperfect detection are 1) carcasses fall into unsearched areas, 2) carcasses are removed or destroyed before sampling, and 3) carcasses present in the searched area are missed by observers. Search plots large enough to comprise 100% of turbine-induced fatality are expensive to search and may nonetheless contain areas unsearchable because of dangerous terrain or impenetrable brush. We evaluated models relating carcass density to distance from the turbine to estimate the proportion of carcasses expected to fall in searched areas and evaluated the statistical cost of restricting searches to areas near turbines where carcass density is highest and search conditions optimal. We compared 5 estimators differing in assumptions about the relationship of carcass density to distance from the turbine. We tested them on 6 different carcass dispersion scenarios at each of 3 sites under 2 different search regimes. We found that even simple distance-based carcass-density models were more effective at reducing bias than was a 5-fold expansion of the search area. Estimators incorporating fitted rather than assumed models were least biased, even under restricted searches. Accurate estimates of fatality at wind-power facilities will allow critical comparisons of rates among turbines, sites, and regions and contribute to our understanding of the potential environmental impact of this technology.

The southwest United States has high bat species diversity and is an important area for migratory species, although little is known about their seasonal distribution. To examine potential risk to bats in areas proposed for wind energy development, we characterized bat occupancy spatially and temporally across northern Arizona, identifying use during summer when bats are reproductively active and fall during the migratory season. Our objectives were to determine occupancy of migratory species and species of greatest conservation need and develop a probability of occupancy map for species to identify areas of potential conflict with wind energy development. We selected 92 sites in 10 clusters with potential for development and used acoustic detectors to sample bats in the summer and fall of 2016 and 2017 for 6 nights per site per year. We predicted response of migratory bat species and species of special concern to 9 landscape variables using Program MARK. During summer, higher densities of forest on the landscape resulted in a higher probability of occupancy of migratory species such as hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), big free-tailed bats (Nyctinomops macrotis), and species of conservation need such as spotted bats (Euderma maculatum). During the fall, higher concentration of valleys on the landscape predicted occupancy of hoary bats, big free-tailed bats, and spotted bats. High bat occupancy in the fall was also associated with higher elevation and close proximity to forests.

There was no evidence of population substructure in either species. Genetic diversity at mitochondrial and microsatellite loci was lower in these yellow bat taxa than in previously studied migratory tree bat species in North America, which may be due to the non-migratory nature of these species at our study site, the fact that our study site is located at a geographic range end for both taxa, and possibly weak ascertainment bias at microsatellite loci. Historical effective population size (N-EF) was large for both species, while current estimates of Ne had upper 95% confidence limits that encompassed infinity. We found evidence of strong mitochondrial differentiation between the two putative subspecies of D. intermedius (D. i. floridanus and D. i. intermedius) which are sympatric in this region of Texas, yet little differentiation using microsatellite loci. We suggest this pattern is due to secondary contact and hybridization and possibly incomplete lineage sorting at microsatellite loci.

Currently, impact loads are not considered during blade design, so high safety factors are introduced, which result in a conservative design. However, as wind turbine blades become stiffer and lighter and health monitoring systems become more sophisticated, the design process is shifting toward damage-tolerant approaches. The design philosophy accepts damages to the structure, but it also requires that the damaged blade still meet structural and functional requirements. This design procedure requires a comprehensive understanding of different impact threats and their characteristics, which is currently unavailable in the public domain. This paper is a first attempt to review the impact loads on composite wind turbine blades.

Bats almost always use echolocation, even when other sensory stimuli are available to guide navigation. Here, using arrays of calibrated infrared cameras and ultrasonic microphones, we demonstrate that hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) itse previously unknown echolocation behaviours that challenge our current understanding of echolocation. We describe a novel call type ('micro' calls) that has three orders of magnitude less sound energy than other bat calls used in open habitats. We also document bats flying close to microphones (less than 3 m) without producing detectable echolocation calls. Acoustic modelling indicates that bats are not producing calls that exceed 70-75 dB at 0.1 m, a level that would have little or no known use for a bat flying in he open at speeds exceeding 7 ms(-1). This indicates that hoary bats some- times fly without echolocation. We speculate that bats reduce echolocation output to avoid eavesdropping by conspecifics during the mating season. These findings might partly explain why tens of thousands of hoary bats are killed by wind turbines each year. They also challenge the long-standing assumption that bats-model organisms for sensory specialization-are reliant on sonar for nocturnal navigation.",research,United States of America,45,27,27,3,61,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

We have little understanding of wind turbine effects on bat population persistence, in part because we have poor knowledge of bat migration pathways and hence the source populations for individual fatalities. We used deuterium ratio analysis combined with genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction and the web-based isoscapes modeling, analysis, and prediction in a geographic information system environment as a novel approach. Our objectives were to explore the utility of these methods together and map the geographic extents of eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) specimens salvaged in 2008-2010 from a single, 92-km(2) wind energy facility in Illinois, USA. Results indicate that combining these methods can be successful and support their use with species where ranges may be less well defined. Because of the migratory nature of this species and the range of deuterium values of pixels in our isotope model, we predicted that 18% and 82% of the specimens would have isotope results inside and outside of the wind facility's isocline respectively. We concluded that 71.4% of the specimens had isotope signatures placing them outside the wind facility's isocline. It could be argued that the wide distribution of bat fatalities dilutes the overall effect of those fatalities on the bat species; however, if other facilities show a similar pattern, each facility could have cumulative and far reaching population-level effects.

To initiate a preliminary understanding of movement patterns of gray bats (Myotis grisescens), we gathered all occurrence and band recovery data available within the range of the species to model movement. By weighting the pathways using the population of winter and summer locations (i.e., cave roosts), we created a heat map demonstrating the likelihood of landscape use by gray bats including nightly foraging, migration, and roost switching. The resulting map highlighted 2 major areas of use during spring and fall migration: 3 high likelihood pathways through central Tennessee and 1 primary migration route between northern Arkansas and central Missouri, USA.

Understanding the timing of migration can help reduce the risk of disturbance via anthropogenic activities, guide effective management, and determine future impacts of a changing climate. We examined the influence of weather and day of year on the arrival and departure of Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) monitored at a summer maternity colony site in central Indiana from 1998 to 2014, using emergence count data to track the timing of bat presence during the spring and fall migration seasons. We used an information theoretic approach to compare 23 models that predicted bat presence as a function of weather, climate, and lunar illumination; these models predicted arrival of the first Indiana bat and the first observation of a colony in spring, and the last observation of a colony and the last bat observed in fall. Bats embarked on spring and fall migrations to the maternity colony area at approximately the same time each year (arriving similar to 3 April and departing similar to 7 October) and variation was accounted for by changes in weather. Spring arrival and colony formation were predicted by higher temperatures ((x) over bar = 22.5 degrees C for colony formation) and precipitation and lower wind speeds, whereas lower temperatures ((x) over bar = 25.9 degrees C for colony breakup) and precipitation and higher wind predicted colony breakup and departure in fall.

Designing these surveys presents unique challenges, particularly when a probabilistic sample is required for drawing inference to unsampled areas. Sampling frame errors and other logistical constraints often require survey sites to be dropped from the sample and new sites added. Maintaining spatial balance and representativeness of the sample when these changes are made can be problematic. Spatially balanced sampling designs recently developed to support aquatic surveys along rivers provide solutions to a number of practical challenges faced by bat researchers and allow for sample site additions and deletions, support unequal-probability selection of sites, and provide an approximately unbiased local neighborhood-weighted variance estimator that is efficient for spatially structured populations such as is typical for bats. We implemented a spatially balanced design to survey canyon bat (Parastrellus hesperus) activity along a stream network. The spatially balanced design accommodated typical logistical challenges and yielded a 25% smaller estimated standard error for the mean activity level than the usual simple random sampling estimator. Spatially balanced designs have broad application to bat research and monitoring programs and will improve studies relying on model-based inference (e. g., occupancy models) by providing flexibility and protection against violations of the independence assumption, even if design-based estimators are not used. Our approach is scalable and can be used for pre- and post-construction surveys along wind turbine arrays and for regional monitoring programs.

Multi-species HSMs highlight high quality habitat (i.e., ecologically important habitat that provides preferred resources for roosting, foraging, and raising young) in southern Illinois and along river riparian areas.

Wind energy developments, in particular, are known to cause bird and bat mortalities, and to fragment habitat for terrestrial vertebrates within developed project areas. Effects on species sensitive to wind turbines (and increased prevalence of species tolerant to this disturbance) might alter community-level patterns of occurrence, with potentially detrimental changes to wildlife habitat and ecosystem health. Aims. The present study assessed whether wind energy developments produced downstream ecological costs. Specifically, community composition and diversity were compared between wind farms and nearby areas without energy development. Methods. Traditional diversity measures and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were used to map ecological dissimilarity across four wind farms and five reference (control) areas in Southern California, USA. Key results. Wind farms had more noise and road disturbance than sites without turbine installations. Noise and disturbance were correlated with reduced plant richness, particularly for endemic plant species and, conversely, with increased non-native plant richness. Animal communities at wind farms were less diverse, with fewer species and lower evenness relative to reference areas with minor or no disturbances. Wind farms had fewer rare and unique species and, for some species of avian predators, encounter rates were lower at wind farms. Conclusions. Renewable wind energy may indeed cause shifts in local communities. Although wind farms still supported many of the same species found in natural areas, suggesting that renewable wind energy facilities can provide useable habitat for some wildlife, these communities were also less rich and diverse.",research,United States of America,104,10,10,2,90,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

We compared over-water flight movements to randomly generated patterns using a use-availability framework, and subsequently used a generalized linear mixed effects model to assess the relationship of over-water flight to atmospheric variables. We used hidden Markov models to assess daily activity patterns and site residency. Most bats with long-distance movements traveled in a southwesterly direction, however path vectors were often oriented interior toward the continental landmass rather than along the coastline. We observed that some bats transited wide sections of the Chesapeake and Delaware bays, confirming their ability to travel across large water bodies. This over-water flight typically occurred in the early hours of the night and during favorable flying conditions. If flight over large water bodies is a proxy for over-ocean flight, then collision risk at offshore wind turbines - a major source of migratory bat fatalities - may be linked nightly to warm temperatures that occur early in the fall season.

Our specific goals are to: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of isolating RADseq loci from these tree bat species, 2) test for genetic structure within each species, including any structure that may be associated with time (migration period), and 3) use coalescent-based modeling approaches to estimate genetically-effective population sizes and patterns of population size changes over evolutionary timescales. Thousands of loci were successfully genotyped for each species, demonstrating the value of RADseq for generating polymorphic loci for population genetic analyses in these bats. There was no evidence for genetic differentiation between groups of samples collected at different times throughout spring and fall migration, suggesting that individuals from each species found at the wind facility are from single panmictic populations. Estimates of present-day effective population sizes varied across species, but were consistently large, on the order of 10(5)-10(6). All populations show evidence of expansions that date to the Pleistocene.

Bat fatalities can be reduced by altering turbine operations, but such curtailment decreases turbine efficiency. If additional ways of reducing bat fatalities at wind turbines were available such tradeoffs might not be needed. Based on the facts that bats perceive distant objects primarily through vision and can see in very dim lighting conditions, and the possibility that bats might interact with turbines after approaching them as they would trees, we propose a novel method of reducing bat activity at wind turbines: illumination of the structure with dim light. As a first step toward assessing this approach, we illuminated trees with dim flickering ultraviolet (UV) light in areas frequented by Hawaiian hoary bats Lasiurus cinereus semotus, an endangered subspecies affected by wind turbines. We used a repeated-measures design to quantify bat activity near trees with acoustic detectors and thermal video cameras in the presence and absence of UV illumination, while concurrently monitoring insect numbers. Results indicate that dim UV reduces bat activity despite an increase in insect numbers. Experimental treatment did not completely inhibit bat activity near trees, nor did all measures of bat activity show statistically significant differences due to high variance in bat activity among sites.

Currently used bias-adjustment methods differ across studies, do not explicitly account for factors that may affect initial bias estimates, and often use averaged or assumed levels of bias. We examined scavenging and detection trial data from a 3-y study at a small, terrestrial wind-farm in coastal New Jersey. Logistic regression models indicated that carcass size, substrate, and observer all affected carcass detection rates, with larger carcasses more likely to be detected than smaller carcasses, and those located on bare ground or grass more likely to be detected than those on gravel.

We suggest that empirically based estimates of factors affecting observer detection and scavenging loss be generated for individual wind-farm mortality studies, because they likely vary across sites and could heavily bias resulting adjustment factors and mortality estimates.",research,United States of America,47,6,7,0,33,J FISH WILDL MANAG,J.

Direct inspections by searchers and unsystematic line transect searches with autos were used in the carcass searches technique. To examine the collected data, the GenEst estimator was used. During a systematic search, six bird carcasses/remains were discovered, three of which belonged to migratory soaring birds (MSB) with the least concern status. During the unsystematic search, two MSB and one Passerine carcasses were discovered, but no bat carcasses were found as collision victims. Furthermore, no bird or bat carcasses were detected beneath the high voltage powerlines that run parallel to the wind farm. Carcass persistence trials revealed that MSB lasted 23.92 days while little passerines lasted 3 days. The detection probability for all decay types was 87.2, 93.3 % for MSB, and 41.9 % for tiny Passerines.

Hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) are among the bat species most commonly killed by wind turbine strikes in the midwestern United States. The impact of this mortality on species census size is not understood, due in part to the difficulty of estimating population size for this highly migratory and elusive species. Genetic effective population size (Ne) could provide an index of changing census population size if other factors affecting Ne are stable. Methods. We used the NeEstimator package to derive effective breeding population size (Nb) estimates for two temporally spaced cohorts: 93 hoary bats collected in 2009-2010 and an additional 93 collected in 2017-2018. We sequenced restriction-site associated polymorphisms and generated a de novo genome assembly to guide the removal of sex-linked and multi-copy loci, as well as identify physically linked markers. Results. Analysis of the reference genome with psmc suggested at least a doubling of Ne in the last 100,000 years, likely exceeding Ne = 10,000 in the Holocene. Allele and genotype frequency analyses confirmed that the two cohorts were comparable, although some samples had unusually high or low observed heterozygosities. Additionally, the older cohort had lower mean coverage and greater variability in coverage, and batch effects of sampling locality were observed that were consistent with sample degradation. We therefore excluded samples with low coverage or outlier heterozygosity, as well as loci with sequence coverage far from the mode value, from the final data set. Prior to excluding these outliers, contemporary Nb estimates were significantly higher in the more recent cohort, but this finding was driven by high values for the 2018 sample year and low values for all other years. In the reduced data set, Nb did not differ significantly between cohorts. We found base substitutions to be strongly biased toward cytosine to thymine or the complement, and further partitioning loci by substitution type had a strong effect on Nb estimates. Minor allele frequency and base quality bias thresholds also had strong effects on Nb estimates. Instability of Nb with respect to common data filtering parameters and empirically identified factors prevented robust comparison of the two cohorts. Given that confidence intervals frequently included infinity as the stringency of data filtering increased, contemporary trends in Nb of North American hoary bats may not be tractable with the linkage disequilibrium method, at least using the protocol employed here.",research,United States of America,77,3,3,2,13,PEERJ,PeerJ,19-Apr,2021,9,,10.7717/peerj.11285,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11285,,,27,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

The rarity of found carcasses is exacerbated when live members of a particular species are rare and when carcasses degrade quickly, are removed by scavengers, or are not detected by observers. With few observed carcass counts, common statistical methods like logistic, Poisson, or negative binomial regression are unreliable (statistically biased) and often fail to provide answers (i.e., fail to converge). Here, we propose a binomial N-mixture model that estimates fatality rates as well as the total number of carcasses when rates are expanded. Our model extends the evidence of absence model by relating carcass deposition rates to study covariates and by incorporating terms that naturally scale counts from facilities of different sizes. Our model, which we call Evidence of Absence Regression (EoAR), can estimate the total number of birds or bats killed at a single wind energy facility or a fleet of wind energy facilities based on covariate values. Furthermore, with accurate prior distributions the model's results are extremely robust to sparse data and unobserved combinations of covariate values.

To address the problem of gathering high-quality, long-term data on these species in this remote environment, we designed a multi-sensor system that was recently deployed for 6 months in 2021 and 2022. Two Acoustic and Thermographic Offshore Monitoring (ATOMTM) systems were deployed on wind turbines 23 nautical miles off the coast of Virginia, USA. The systems were operational during the day and night and recorded 1,581 detections of birds and bats, with 99% of detections occurring in the fall. Most detections were of birds, including 5 shorebird species, 3 gull species, 1 tern species, 3 raptor species, 1 woodpecker species, and 18 passerine species. Skuas, corvids, and swallows were also observed. There were 521 detections of bats. Differences between species detected and identified in each sensor confirms that a multi-sensor approach for monitoring is beneficial. There were no observed collisions; two individuals (1 bird and 1 bat) suffered air displacement, causing them to fall, but they recovered and continued flying. ATOM also collected novel data on insects, tracking over 7,000 insects around the turbine rotor swept zone and revealed foraging behaviour in 596 of the 1,581 bird and bat detections. Offshore wind turbines thus provide potential sites for perching and foraging. Although these turbine sites provide a new opportunity to feed, which may be beneficial for insectivores and omnivores in enabling them to reach migration destinations in better condition, the consequences of a potentially delayed arrival are unknown (positive, negative, or neutral). Overall, our approach produced the first detailed insights into terrestrial land bird and bat activity around offshore turbines, providing novel information on changes in behaviour when turbine blades are moving and during higher wind speeds. Moreover, our data show that foraging activity appears to be conducted with an awareness of the moving blades and in safe zones close but parallel to blade movements. We recorded 113 observations of activity within 10 m of the moving blades and 70 observations where interactions with moving turbine blades were within 1 m; we call these latter avoidance measures nanoavoidance.

Integrating long-term encounter surveys with multi-season occupancy models provides a solution whereby inferences about changing occupancy probabilities and latent changes in abundance can be supported. When harnessed to a Bayesian inferential paradigm, this modeling framework offers flexibility for conservation programs that need to update prior model-based understanding about at-risk species with new data. This scenario is exemplified by a bat monitoring program in the Pacific Northwestern United States in which results from 8 years of surveys from 2003 to 2010 require updating with new data from 2016 to 2018. The new data were collected after the arrival of bat white-nose syndrome and expansion of wind power generation, stressors expected to cause population declines in at least two vulnerable species, little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) and the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus). We used multi-season occupancy models with empirically informed prior distributions drawn from previous occupancy results (2003-2010) to assess evidence of contemporary decline in these two species. Empirically informed priors provided the bridge across the two monitoring periods and increased precision of parameter posterior distributions, but did not alter inferences relative to use of vague priors. We found evidence of region-wide summertime decline for the hoary bat (lambda<^> = 0.86 +/- 0.10) since 2010, but no evidence of decline for the little brown bat (lambda<^> = 1.1 +/- 0.10). White-nose syndrome was documented in the region in 2016 and may not yet have caused regional impact to the little brown bat. However, our discovery of hoary bat decline is consistent with the hypothesis that the longer duration and greater geographic extent of the wind energy stressor (collision and barotrauma) have impacted the species. These hypotheses can be evaluated and updated over time within our framework of pre-post impact monitoring and modeling. Our approach provides the foundation for a strategic evidence-based conservation system and contributes to a growing preponderance of evidence from multiple lines of inquiry that bat species are declining.",research,United States of America,68,46,46,1,48,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In total, we recorded 4432 bat-call sequences and documented the presence of at least 6 species: Lasiurus borealis (Eastern Red Bat), Eptesicus fuscus (Big Brown Bat), Nycticeius humeralis (Evening Bat), L. cinereus (Hoary Bat), Perimyotis subflavus (Tri-colored Bat), 1 or more species in the genus Myotis, and potentially Lasionycteris noctivagans (Silver-haired Bat). Given the similarity in call structure between Silver-haired and Big Brown Bats, we cannot say with certainty the former were present. Eastern Red Bats, Evening Bats, and Hoary Bats were relatively widespread and abundant; Tri-colored Bat and Myotis were not. Of the species for which adequate sample sizes were available, all but the Hoary Bat (and possibly the Silver-haired Bat) showed strong preferences for forest edges, demonstrating the importance of these landscape features for maintaining healthy bat populations.

We took advantage of the large numbers of L. borealis and L. cinereus salvaged during fall migration at 1 wind farm in Texas and 3 wind farms in Minnesota to evaluate the ability of current genetic methods to estimate population size and detect genetic bottlenecks in these species. Using DNA extracted from wing membrane tissue samples, we genotyped 439 L. borealis and 246 L. cinereus at 6 microsatellite loci and a 550 bp segment of the mitochondrial COI gene. Both microsatellite loci and mitochondrial haplotypes showed high levels of genetic diversity in each species. Historical estimates of N-e were large for both species. Estimates of N-ef from the COI gene were almost 2 times higher for L. borealis than L. cinereus, whereas estimates utilizing microsatellite heterozygosity were higher for L. cinereus. We found a strong signal of rapid historical population growth and range expansion in L. borealis, but not in L. cinereus. The majority of our estimates of current N-e had upper 95% confidence intervals that encompassed infinity. There is some indication from contemporary estimates of N-e that L. borealis may have a lower current N-e than historical estimates and that L. cinereus may currently have a very large N-e. We found no genetic evidence of recent population declines and no evidence of population structure in either species. Genetic monitoring of migratory tree bats, specifically for the purpose of detecting population declines caused by wind turbine mortality, may be impractical due to the large effective population sizes and high levels of gene flow in these species. Future efforts should focus on developing genomic resources for these species, obtaining better estimates of mutation rates, and conducting range-wide population genetic studies in order to better estimate historical and current population sizes.

Reduction in wildlife mortality is often cited as a potential advantage to repowering wind facilities, that is, replacing smaller, lower capacity, closely spaced turbines, with larger, higher capacity ones, more widely spaced. Wildlife mortality rates, however, are affected by more than just size and spacing of turbines, varying with turbine operation, seasonal and daily weather and habitat, all of which can confound our ability to accurately measure the effect of repowering on wildlife mortality rates. 2. We investigated the effect of repowering on wildlife mortality rates in a study conducted near Palm Springs, CA. We controlled for confounding effects of weather and habitat by measuring turbine-caused wildlife mortality rates over a range of turbine sizes and spacing, all within the same time period, habitat and local weather conditions. We controlled for differences in turbine operation by standardizing mortality rate per unit energy produced. 3. We found that avian and bat mortality rate was constant per unit of energy produced, across all sizes and spacings of turbines. 4. Synthesis and applications. In the context of repowering a wind facility, our results suggest that the relative amount of energy produced, rather than simply the size, spacing or nameplate capacity of the replacement turbines, determines the relative rate of mortality prior to and after repowering. Consequently, in a given location, newer turbines would be expected to be less harmful to wildlife only if they produced less energy than the older models they replace. The implications are far-reaching as 18% of US and 8% of world-wide wind power capacity will likely be considered for repowering within similar to 5 years.",research,United States of America,34,10,12,1,12,J APPL ECOL,J.

This limitation inhibits our understanding of bat dispersal and migration, particularly in the context of emerging conservation issues such as fatalities at wind turbines and diseases. We tested a novel method of attaching lightweight global positioning system (GPS) tags and geolocating data loggers to small bats. We used monofilament, synthetic, absorbable sutures to secure GPS tags and data loggers to the skin of anesthetized big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in Colorado and hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) in California. GPS tags and data loggers were sutured to 17 bats in this study. Three tagged bats were recaptured 7months after initial deployment, with tags still attached; none of these bats showed ill effects from the tag. No severe injuries were apparent upon recapture of 6 additional bats that carried tags up to 26days after attachment; however, one of the bats exhibited skin chafing. Use of absorbable sutures to affix small tracking devices seems to be a safe, effective method for studying movements of bats over multiple months, although additional testing is warranted. This new attachment method has the potential to quickly advance our understanding of small bats, particularly as more sophisticated miniature tracking devices (e.g., satellite tags) become available.",research,United States of America,35,18,20,0,63,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Thus, it is essential to understand wildlife-interactions with tall structures to implement effective mitigation strategies. Yet, we are currently lacking standard protocols for visual surveys of wildlife behavior at such heights. Our study sought to determine an effective, repeatable method using readily available night vision and thermal technology to survey wildlife at tall structures. Using bats as the taxonomic group of interest, we (1) created a key to identify bats and their behavior, (2) compared the effectiveness of 2 different technologies, and (3) assessed optimal equipment placement to visually capture bat activity and behavior in proximity to wind turbine towers. For the latter, we tested thermal cameras at four distances from the base of the tower. The results of our study revealed that thermal cameras captured similar to 34% more flying animals than night vision at a 2 m distance. However, due to the heat signature of the turbine towers themselves, it was challenging to identify behaviors and interactions that occurred in close proximity to the towers. In contrast, it was difficult to identify bats approaching the towers using night vision, yet we were able to clearly observe interactions with the towers themselves. With regards to equipment placement, we visually captured more bats with the thermal cameras placed 2 m from the tower base compared to farther distances. From our findings, we recommend that when using either thermal or night vision technology at tall structures, they be placed 2 m from the base to effectively observe interactions along the length of these structures. In addition, we further recommend that consideration be given to the use of these two technology types together to effectively conduct such surveys. If these survey techniques are incorporated into standard protocols, future surveys at a variety of tall structures are likely to become comparable and repeatable, thereby more effectively informing any mitigation strategies that may be required.",research,United States of America,56,4,4,3,12,PEERJ,PeerJ,12-Feb,2020,8,,10.7717/peerj.8438,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8438,,,21,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Patterns of bat activity and mortality at wind energy facilities suggest that bats are attracted to wind turbines. It has been more than a decade since a comprehensive review of the various attraction hypotheses was published, highlighting the need to revisit and assess progress in the testing of these ideas. In this review, we discuss the most prominent attraction hypotheses, summarize the current state of knowledge, and briefly outline remaining questions. Identifying the causes of bat interactions with wind turbines is critical to developing effective impact minimization strategies. Patterns of bat activity and mortalities at wind energy facilities suggest that bats are attracted to wind turbines based on bat behavioral responses to wind turbines. For example, current monitoring efforts suggest that bat activity increases post-wind turbine construction, with bats making multiple passes near wind turbines. We separated the attraction hypothesis into five previously proposed explanations of bat interactions at or near wind turbines, including attraction based on noise, roost sites, foraging and water, mating behavior, and lights, and one new hypothesis regarding olfaction, and provide a state of the knowledge in 2022. Our review indicates that future research should prioritize attraction based on social behaviors, such as mating and scent-marking, as this aspect of the attraction hypothesis has many postulates and remains the most unclear. Relatively more data regarding attraction to wind turbines based on lighting and noise emission exist, and these data indicate that these are unlikely attractants. Analyzing attraction at the species-level should be prioritized because of differences in foraging, flight, and social behavior among bat species. Lastly, research assessing bat attraction at various scales, such as the turbine or facility scale, is lacking, which could provide important insights for both wind turbine siting decisions and bat mortality minimization strategies.

Species of bats consistently affected by turbines tend to be those that rely on trees as roosts and most migrate long distances. Although considerable progress has been made in recent years toward better understanding the problem, the causes of bat fatalities at turbines remain unclear. In this synthesis, we review hypothesized causes of bat fatalities at turbines. Hypotheses of cause fall into 2 general categories-proximate and ultimate. Proximate causes explain the direct means by which bats die at turbines and include collision with towers and rotating blades, and barotrauma. Ultimate causes explain why bats come close to turbines and include 3 general types: random collisions, coincidental collisions, and collisions that result from attraction of bats to turbines. The random collision hypothesis posits that interactions between bats and turbines are random events and that fatalities are representative of the bats present at a site. Coincidental hypotheses posit that certain aspects of bat distribution or behavior put them at risk of collision and include aggregation during migration and seasonal increases in flight activity associated with feeding or mating. A surprising number of attraction hypotheses suggest that bats might be attracted to turbines out of curiosity, misperception, or as potential feeding, roosting, flocking, and mating opportunities.

Many fatality estimates have been made across North America, but they have varied greatly in field and analytical methods, monitoring duration, and in the size and height of the wind turbines monitored for fatalities, and few benefited from scientific peer review. To improve comparability among estimates, I reviewed available reports of fatality monitoring at wind-energy projects throughout North America, and I applied a common estimator and 3 adjustment factors to data collected from these reports. To adjust fatality estimates for proportions of carcasses not found during routine monitoring, I used national averages from hundreds of carcass placement trials intended to characterize scavenger removal and searcher detection rates, and I relied on patterns of carcass distance from wind turbines to develop an adjustment for variation in maximum search radius around wind turbines mounted on various tower heights. Adjusted fatality rates correlated inversely with wind-turbine size for all raptors as a group across the United States, and for all birds as a group within the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area, California. I estimated 888,000 bat and 573,000 bird fatalities/year (including 83,000 raptor fatalities) at 51,630 megawatt (MW) of installed wind-energy capacity in the United States in 2012.

In this paper we operationalize the landscape service approach and generate conflict maps between three renewable energies (wind; PV; forest biomass) and six competing landscape services (nutrition and materials; aesthetics; physical and experiential interactions; heritage and symbolic content; water and liquid flows; lifecycle maintenance, habitat and gene pool protection). Media content analysis and expert interviews were used to ground-truth the national conflict maps in several Swiss regions and to understand to what degree the national conflict assessments match the regional and local perceptions of these conflicts. In Switzerland (approximately 40,000 km(2)) biomass from forests is by far the least conflicting renewable energy, followed by PV on roofs. For the latter 68% of the technically feasible energy potential can be generated with low conflicts, and more is expected with new materials. Wind has a high conflict potential: only 12% of the technically feasible energy potential is low conflict. PV on open land, marginal land and shrubland, is - at the moment - not currently feasible in Switzerland. The accuracy of our conflict assessment is sufficiently high to estimate the proportion that socially sustainable energy could cover of the overall energy gap of 22-25 TWh/yr caused by the phaseout of Swiss nuclear plants by 2050. Low-conflict solar energy from rooftops could contribute approximately 30% of the required 22-25 TWh/yr. Intensified wood production and wind energy could add another 40%. The gap of approximately 30% must come from undisputed energy sources such as biogas from recycled organic material, from centralized renewable energies such as geothermal or large hydropower, or from new or technologically improved renewable energies. The presented decision support tools are a timely contribution to the designation of legally binding zones for renewable energy production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An onboard, integrated multisensor system capable of providing detection of turbine collision events, including taxonomic information, was developed. The conceptual design of a multisensor system including a vibration sensing node, an optics node, and an bioacoustic node with an event-driven trigger architecture was field-tested on utility-scale wind turbines. A pixel density computational model was built to estimate the spatial coverage and target resolution to the optimized configuration for camera placement. Field test results of the vibration node showed that nearly half of the recorded impact events were successfully identified by visual inspection and running short-time Fourier transform on recorded vibration signals. The remaining undetected impact events were masked under background noise due to low impact energy and high background noise of the operating turbine, which result in subsequent low signal-to-noise ratio.

The sights and sounds of turbines, while considered an infringement on the environment, are seldom recognized as a visual and auditory warnings to birds and bats. Declining bird casualties in successive years implies a learning process in the birds where the view and noise of turbines have taught remaining birds and bats to stay away. This paper discusses providing additional auditory and visual stimuli that will further catch the attention of the birds, helping associate the sights and sounds with mortal danger. Sounds such as screeching and gunshots are recommended, based on what would be disturbing and repelling to birds and bats, and not much audible beyond the immediate vicinity of the turbine. Different sounds may be generated for different species, such as ultrasonic sounds for bats. Ultra-violet patterns painted on the blades may catch the visual attention of the birds, without being too obstrusive to human vision. Warning visual patterns and bird-repelling sounds should be similar for turbines, so that birds do not have to re-learn the warnings for different turbines.

A label green) source of energy is given to them, although they represent a threat for wildlife population, and the ethical question is raised if we should influence on decline (or extinction) of birds and bats due to decreased influence on climatic changes? Possible effects of wind turbines on birds and bats depends on a range of factors, related to topography of the area, type of habitat, number of species and individual animals on certain area, and they should be assessed on a site-by-site basis. Many factors depend on collision of birds and bats with wind turbine structures, depending on species (size), number of individuals, behavior, age, movements, experience, weather conditions, direction and force of wind, topography, wind turbine structure and availability of alternative corridors. Risks are greater on the (or near) feeding and roosting sites, on migration flyways or local flight paths. Large birds have poor maneuverability. During bad weather conditions, low visibility andfog, risks are increased. Migrating birds cannot interrupt migration due to bad weather, and will be more vulnerable if forced by low cloud to descend to a lower altitude or land. Particular topographic features of the area may be used for elevating soaring species or can result in large number of birds being funneled through an area of turbines. In order to avoid negative effects of wind turbines on wildlife, basic studies should be done with thorough professional assessment on justification of constructing wind farms on certain location.

The leading edges and the peripheral regions of the blades are most likely to strike birds and bats, which may be trained to keep away by the colors, lighting and sounds of leading edges. Lights and sounds need only have a range of a few tens of meters and directionality towards the danger zone, meaning the lights and sounds will be imperceptible to humans in the vicinity.

In North America, for example, there are increasing concerns that wind turbines threaten the persistence of populations of migratory tree-roosting bats, such as the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus). Because it is not possible to monitor population sizes for these solitary and cryptic species using traditional techniques, we must rely on other methods, such as acoustic and genetic monitoring, to provide information regarding population status and trends. Using these approaches, we can build a weight of evidence to assess whether mortality associated with wind turbines is sustainable and determine if and when mitigation measures should be implemented to reduce wind turbine mortality. To this end, we recommend that acoustic data be collected using the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) protocols, and that genetic diversity be monitored at repeated time intervals to document species trends. There are no short-term measures to resolve population-level questions for migratory tree-roosting bats. Nonetheless, we discuss opportunities for relatively short-term investments that will lead to long-term success in reducing uncertainty for these species. Wind turbine-related mortality may pose a population-level threat for migratory tree-roosting bats, such as the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) in North America. These species are dispersed within their range, making it impractical to estimate census populations size using traditional survey methods. Nonetheless, understanding population size and trends is essential for evaluating and mitigating risk from wind turbine mortality. Using various sampling techniques, including systematic acoustic sampling and genetic analyses, we argue that building a weight of evidence regarding bat population status and trends is possible to (1) assess the sustainability of mortality associated with wind turbines; (2) determine the level of mitigation required; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures to ensure population viability for these species. Long-term, systematic data collection remains the most viable option for reducing uncertainty regarding population trends for migratory tree-roosting bats. We recommend collecting acoustic data using the statistically robust North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) protocols and that genetic diversity is monitored at repeated time intervals to show species trends.

Alameda County implemented an Avian Protection Program requiring mitigation measures and eventual repowering to modern wind turbines, all intended to reduce raptor fatality rates 50% from levels estimated for 1998-2003. Two years into the 3-year program, we compared estimates of fatality rates between 1998-2003 and 2005-2007 and between a repowered wind project (Diablo Winds) and the APWRA's old-generation wind turbines. The APWRA-wide fatality rates increased significantly for multiple bird species, including 85% for all raptors and 51% for all birds. Fatality rates caused by the Diablo Winds repowering project were not lower than replaced turbines, but they were 54% and 66% lower for raptors and all birds, respectively, than those of concurrently operating old-generation turbines in 2005-2007. Because new-generation turbines can generate nearly 3 times the energy per megawatt of rated capacity compared to the APWRA's old turbines, repowering the APWRA could reduce mean annual fatality rates by 54% for raptors and 65% for all birds, while more than doubling annual wind-energy generation. Alternatively, the nameplate capacity of a repowered APWRA could be restricted to 209 megawatts to meet current energy generation (about 700 gigawatt-hr), thereby reducing mean annual fatalities by 83% for raptors and 87% for all birds. In lieu of repowering, bird fatalities could be reduced by enforcing operating permits and environmental laws and by the County requiring implementation of the Alameda County Scientific Review Committee's recommendations.

The search for fatalities and the quantification of their number is an important tool to understand the adverse effects of wind turbines on bats and birds. This method has several problems: Cadavers do not always remain on site due to predators, only a part of the relevant area on the ground can be searched manually and not all fatalities can be found. This leads to the fact that searches, although extremely valuable in the analysis of animal mortality, are hardly used in practice due to the high effort and enormous costs. The present work closes this research gap by proposing a radar barrier approach that automatically detects animal fatality in real-time. Therefore, three FMCW radar systems are attached to the tower of a wind turbine at different heights.

Although this is a serious challenge for the designer, their optimum design is an imperative for success in reaching the optimal blade shape. In this regard, the use of a suitable tool can be very effective in achieving this important goal. Furthermore, in order to improve the performance of large wind turbines, an objective function involving the combination of parameters of solidity and power coefficients are provided. The output power of the wind turbine is presented as the power coefficient of this objective function. Based on the presented objective function, it is sought to maximize power generation and minimize solidity. A decrease in solidity can cause weight loss of blades and ultimately reduce costs and consumed materials.

Wind energy has been investigated as a viable source of energy in recent years and several new design concepts have been introduced to benefit from high-speed winds at higher altitudes. Buoyant airborne turbine (BAT) is a similar concept designed to exploit high altitude winds by lifting the whole wind turbine system within a toroidal shaped shell filled with helium. The present study investigates the aerodynamic performance of the BAT shell based on a NACA-9415 airfoil with different rotor blade tip clearances. Three-dimensional analysis has been conducted considering a two-bladed NREL Phase IV rotor at a variety of wind speeds for the tip gaps ranging from 1% to 5% of the shell throat radius. The influence of the blade tip clearance on the turbine performance has been explored by analysing wind turbine aerodynamic coefficients, swallowed mass flow rate and wake generated behind the wind turbine. The results showed a declining trend in the wind turbine power coefficient with the increment in tip clearance for the wind speeds of 10 m/s-20 m/s. However, at the higher wind speed, the turbine power coefficient demonstrated a direct association with the tip clearance for the tip gaps of 1%-3% followed by a drop in the turbine power coefficient at the wider tip clearance.",no,,42,28,28,1,15,ENERG CONVERS MANAGE,Energy Conv.

The loss of even small numbers of individuals may adversely affect fragile populations, but typically, few (if any) carcasses are observed during monitoring. If monitoring design results in only a small proportion of carcasses detected, then finding zero carcasses may give little assurance that the number of actual fatalities is small. Fatality monitoring at wind-power facilities commonly involves conducting experiments to estimate the probability (g) an individual will be observed, accounting for the possibilities that it falls in an unsearched area, is scavenged prior to detection, or remains undetected even when present. When g < 1, the total carcass count (X) underestimates the total number of fatalities (M). Total counts can be 0 when M is small or when M is large and g <<1. Distinguishing these two cases is critical when estimating fatality of a rare species. Observing no individuals during searches may erroneously be interpreted as evidence of absence. We present an approach that uses Bayes' theorem to construct a posterior distribution for M, i.e., P(M|X, g), reflecting the observed carcass count and previously estimated g. From this distribution, we calculate two values important to conservation: the probability that M is below a predetermined limit and the upper bound (M-*) of the 100(1 - )% credible interval for M. We investigate the dependence of M-* on , g, and the prior distribution of M, asking what value of g is required to attain a desired M-* for a given . We found that when g < similar to 0.15, M-* was clearly influenced by the mean and variance of g and the choice of prior distribution for M, but the influence of these factors is minimal when g > similar to 0.45. Further, we develop extensions for temporal replication that can inform prior distributions of M and methods for combining information across several areas or time periods.

In response to global concerns regarding the environmental effects of wind energy, the International Energy Agency Wind Technical Collaborative Program initiated Task 34 - Working Together to Resolve Environmental Effects of Wind Energy or WREN. As part of WREN, this study performed an international assessment with the global wind energy and environmental community to determine priority environmental issues over the next 5-10 years and help support collaborative interactions among researchers, developers, regulators, and stakeholders. Technical summary A systematic assessment was performed using feedback from the international community to identify priority environmental issues for land-based and offshore wind energy development. Given the global nature of wind energy development, feedback was of interest from all countries where such development is underway or planned to help meet United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change targets. The assessment prioritized environmental issues over the next 5-10 years associated with wind energy development and received a total of 294 responses from 28 countries. For land-based wind, the highest-ranked issues included turbine collision risk for volant species (birds and bats), cumulative effects on species and ecosystems, and indirect effects such as avoidance and displacement. For offshore wind, the highest-ranked issues included cumulative effects, turbine collision risk, underwater noise (e.g. marine mammals and fish), and displacement. Emerging considerations for these priorities include potential application to future technologies (e.g. larger turbines and floating turbines), new stressors and species in frontier regions, and cumulative effects for multiple projects at a regional scale. For both land-based and offshore wind, effectiveness of minimization measures (e.g. detection and deterrence technologies) and costs for monitoring, minimization, and mitigation were identified as overarching challenges.

The significant aims of the proposed model are not only to address an exhaustive model for the AHRS by incorporating solar panel, wind turbine, diesel generator, and battery storage components, but also to implement practical considerations on the AHRS by considering its probabilistic characteristics. To do so, the proposed model takes into account total investment cost, the total fuel cost of the diesel generator, total maintenance cost and total expected load shedding cost in the optimization as four problem objectives subject to technical and operational constraints. A modified discrete bat search algorithm is widely employed to obtain the final optimal solution and followed by a Monte Carlo simulation method to handle non-deterministic characteristics pertaining to load demand, solar and wind generations. The obtained results of the proposed model are given and meticulously evaluated.

However, wind turbines are not without impact on biodiversity, rather, they can affect bird and bat populations through collision-induced mortality. It is relatively well studied how wind turbine architecture or the surrounding habitat affect the collision risk of birds and bats. It is much less well understood how losses due to collisions affect bird and bat populations. Moreover, it is currently unknown how the spatial configuration of wind turbines in the landscape affects populations. I addressed these two questions using an individual-based simulation model inspired by the Swiss red kite Milvus milvus population. This species is a frequent collision victim at turbines and one of Europe's sole endemic species. I predicted the fate of populations in relation to the number and spatial configuration of wind turbines. I found that population growth rates declined progressively with an increasing number of wind turbines. These negative effects can be weakened if wind turbines are aggregated in power plants. Quantitatively the results strongly depended on the parametric form of the relationship between collision risk and the distance between wind turbines and kite nest location. Unfortunately, empirical knowledge about this relationship is scarce. As the effect of wind turbines depends on their total number and their spatial configuration within the area inhabited by a raptor population, I emphasise the importance of making environmental impact assessments not on a case-by-case basis but rather for an entire region with all its wind power plants, which collectively exert an impact on a raptor population. This must include the impact of extant as well as planned wind turbines in the same region in order to be biologically meaningful. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Harnessing energy from the wind is a logical alternative; however the cost and efficiency of current wind turbines is a limiting factor. The use of an augmented Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) may become the superior choice to the more common Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs) that are usually associated with the harvesting of wind energy. HAWTs operate on the same principles as large airplane propellers, while VAWTs operate on lift and/or drag principles like an airplane wing or a sail on a boat. VAWTs are currently being investigated for use with circulation control to increase their potential power output. In this paper, two topics will be presented, a comparison between VAWTs and HAWTs for rotor diameter versus key turbine aspects and the impact of VAWTs on environmental concerns, such as bat and bird populations. The Center for Industrial Research Applications (CIRA) at West Virginia University (WVU) is currently developing a concept utilizing circulation control to increase the lift to drag ratio, maximizing the beneficial forces on the VAWT blade, allowing for improved wind energy production. For the comparison between VAWTs and HAWTs, there are currently 14 companies with a total of 34 wind turbines variations representing VAWTs and 11 companies with a total of 40 wind turbines representing HAWTs. Trend studies of VAWT and HAWT diameters to cut-in-speed, rated velocity, max velocity, power output (<100 kW), and power output (>= 100 kW) were created to show the potential of VAWTs. A growing concern with wind energy is the impact on bat and bird populations. It is currently believed that VAWTs reduce the impact of wind energy by altering the interaction with the wind. If these benefits can be proven, then not only are VAWTs potentially more economical, but even more ecofriendly.",no,,14,2,3,0,6,,,,2009,,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering

We provide an overview of available quantitative assessment methods that have been employed outside of the LCIA framework to model the different impacts of wind energy developments on wildlife. Combining the acquired knowledge on impact pathways and associated quantitative methods, we propose possibilities for future approaches for a wind energy impact assessment methodology for LCIA.Results and discussionWind energy production has impacts on terrestrial biodiversity through three main pathways: collision, disturbance, and habitat alterations. Birds and bats are consistently considered the most affected taxonomic groups, with different responses to the before-mentioned impact pathways. Outside of the LCIA framework, current quantitative impact assessment prediction models include collision risk models, species distribution models, individual-based models, and population modeling approaches. Developed indices allow scaling of species-specific vulnerability to mortality, disturbance, and/or habitat alterations.ConclusionsAlthough insight into the causes behind collision risk, disturbance, and habitat alterations for bats and birds is still limited, the current knowledge base enables the development of a robust assessment tool. Modeling the impacts of habitat alterations, disturbance, and collisions within an LCIA framework is most appropriate using species distribution models as those enable the estimation of species' occurrences across a region.

The aerodynamic and centrifugal forces bend the blade along its chord, varying the pitch angle by means of non-consuming mechanisms. Here we introduce a general method based on a universal scaling, which finds the optimal soft materials for the blades to maximize the overall turbine efficiency or rotational power, for any required geometry of classical horizontal-axis turbines. The optimization problem, which depends on various parameters, such as the wind velocity, the rotation rate, the density, the rigidity and the geometry of the blade, is reduced to only two dimensionless parameters: the Cauchy number and the centrifugal number. The blade-element momentum theory is coupled to a torsion spring-based model for the blade deformation. Taking into account realistic incoming wind-velocity distributions in the North Sea and a large wind-turbine geometry, we found a significant increase of the total harvested power, up to + 35%. In addition, the optimal soft material corresponding to the maximal efficiency over the entire working range for a given wind turbine geometry is, within the limits of small blade deformations, scale-independent. Thus experiments on small wind turbines are a possible way to determine the optimal soft materials for larger ones. These flexible blades are found to be between 5% and 20% lighter than the current rigid blades. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",no,,33,14,14,5,31,RENEW ENERG,Renew.

It is also one of the RES which has become economically affordable much before several other RESs have. As a result, next to biomass (and excluding large hydro), wind energy is the RES being most extensively tapped by the world at present. Despite carrying the drawback of intermittency, wind energy has found favor due to its perceived twin virtues of relatively lesser production cost and environment-friendliness. But with increasing use of turbines for harnessing wind energy, the adverse environmental impacts of this RES are increasingly coming to light. The present paper summarizes the current understanding of these impacts and assesses the challenges they are posing. One among the major hurdles has been the NYMBI (not in my backyard) syndrome due to which there is increasing emphasis on installing windfarms several kilometers offshore. But such moves have serious implications for marine life which is already under great stress due to impacts of overfishing, marine pollution, global warming, ozone hole and ocean acidification. Evidence is also emerging that the adverse impacts of wind power plants on wildlife, especially birds and bats, are likely to be much greater than is reflected in the hitherto reported figures of individuals killed per turbine. Likewise recent findings on the impact of noise and flicker generated by the wind turbines indicate that these can have traumatic impacts on individuals who have certain predispositions. But the greatest of emerging concerns is the likely impact of large wind farms on the weather, and possibly the climate. The prospects of wind energy are discussed in the backdrop of these and other rising environmental concerns. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, many studies have explored the direct impacts of wind turbines on wildlife, such as wildlife-turbine collisions, but few have addressed indirect impacts, such as habitat degradation. These potentially subtle impacts can have far reaching effects on the abundance, distribution, survival, and breeding success of wildlife. We conducted a study to assess whether proximity of wind turbines to shrub-nesting birds influenced rates of nest failure associated mainly with depredation and brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). During the primary nesting period of five passerine species, we monitored 253 active nests. We used a logistic-exposure method to model nest fate as a function of the important variables identified (including distance from turbine and brood parasitism). Our results indicate little relation between nest success and distance to turbine, with one exception, the Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerule). For this passerine, we found nests closer to wind turbines had a lower probability of being brood parasitized and subsequently had higher nest success rates. We recommend future studies explore the potential implications of wind energy development on brood parasites, such as the Brown-headed Cowbird. As there is regulatory and social pressure to devise management strategies that reduce the impact of brood parasites on species of concern, any opportunities to decrease the risk of brood parasitism could be of benefit.",no,,54,5,5,1,108,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

Understanding animal behavior in the wild or other unconstrained environments is often based on animal movements. The technology described here is for understanding how bird and bat behavior is affected by the presence of wind turbines, specifically offshore wind turbines which are challenging to monitor. There is a need for both baseline data prior to wind farm construction and post-construction data when the turbines are operating. Thermal cameras were chosen because they are equally effective both night and day. In previous work, we developed a method for generating two-dimensional images of animal motion using thermal video from a single camera. The motion track image is formed by combining a sequence of video frames into a single composite image that shows the entire flight trajectory. Here we demonstrate that the composite motion track images from a stereo pair of thermal cameras can be used directly to generate three-dimensional tracks in real time without the need for an explicit tracking algorithm. The method was evaluated using an unmanned aerial system (UAS) equipped with GPS. The UAS flew both straight and curving trajectories at distances between 50 and 325 m from the camera system. The ThermalTracker-3D estimated positions were within +/- 10 m of the GPS-derived positions in the x and y (flight height) dimensions, and within +/- 20 m in the z (range) dimension for 90% of the data points. The range estimates were within the bounds of the achievable accuracy of the cameras and camera arrangement used. The results demonstrate the practical usefulness of the method for assessing collision risk to seabirds at proposed offshore wind energy sites and for quantifying avoidance behavior at operating offshore wind farms.",no,,21,4,4,3,24,ECOL INFORM,Ecol.

Such challenges include the large size and extensive placement of turbines that may represent potential hazards to birds and bats. However, the associated infrastructure required to support an array of turbines-such as roads and transmission lines-represents an even larger potential threat to wildlife than the turbines themselves because such infrastructure can result in extensive habitat fragmentation and can provide avenues for invasion by exotic species. There are numerous conceptual research opportunities that pertain to issues such as identifying the best and worst placement of sites for turbines that will minimize impacts on birds and bats. Unfortunately, to date very little research of this type has appeared in the peer-reviewed scientific literature; much of it exists in the form of unpublished reports and other forms of gray literature. In this paper, we summarize what is known about the potential impacts of wind farms on wildlife and identify a 3-part hierarchical approach to use the scientific method to assess these impacts. The Lower Gulf Coast (LGC) of Texas, USA, is a region currently identified as having a potentially negative impact on migratory birds and bats, with respect to wind farm development. This area is also a region of vast importance to wildlife from the standpoint of native diversity, nature tourism, and opportunities for recreational hunting. We thus use some of the emergent issues related to wind farm development in the LGC-such as siting turbines on cropland sites as opposed to on native rangelands-to illustrate the kinds of challenges and opportunities that wildlife managers must face as we balance our demand for sustainable energy with the need to conserve and sustain bird migration routes and corridors, native vertebrates, and the habitats that support them.",no,,102,243,252,11,357,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Modern turbines now benefit from engineering expertise, and a large variety of different models exists, depending on the context and needs. However, classical wind turbines are designed to operate within a narrow zone centred around their optimal working point. This limitation prevents the use of sites with variable wind to harvest energy, involving significant energetic and economic losses. Here, we present a new type of bioinspired wind turbine using elastic blades, which passively deform through the air loading and centrifugal effects. This work is inspired from recent studies on insect flight and plant reconfiguration, which show the ability of elastic wings or leaves to adapt to the wind conditions and thereby to optimize performance. We show that in the context of energy production, the reconfiguration of the elastic blades significantly extends the range of operating regimes using only passive, non-consuming mechanisms. The versatility of the new turbine model leads to a large increase of the converted energy rate, up to 35%. The fluid/elasticity mechanisms involved for the reconfiguration capability of the new blades are analysed in detail, using experimental observations and modelling.",no,,31,20,20,1,12,P ROY SOC A-MATH PHY,Proc.

For the migratory Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana), these challenges include identifying and protecting migratory routes and critical roosts in two countries, the United States and Mexico. Knowledge and conservation of bat migratory routes is critical in the face of increasing threats from climate change and wind turbines that might decrease migratory survival. We employ a new modeling approach for bat migration, network modeling, to simulate migratory routes between winter habitat in southern Mexico and summer breeding habitat in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. We use the model to identify key migratory routes and the roosts of greatest conservation value to the overall population. We measure roost importance by the degree to which the overall bat population declined when the roost was removed from the model. The major migratory routes-those with the greatest number of migrants-were between winter habitat in southern Mexico and summer breeding roosts in Texas and the northern Mexican states of Sonora and Nuevo Leon. The summer breeding roosts in Texas, Sonora, and Nuevo Leon were the most important for maintaining population numbers and network structure -these are also the largest roosts. This modeling approach contributes to conservation efforts by identifying the most influential areas for bat populations, and can be used to as a tool to improve our understanding of bat migration for other species.

In this paper, we studied the utilization of functioning wind farm areas by four terrestrial animals common to agricultural landscapes: European roe deer, European hare, red fox, and the common pheasant. Firstly, we expected that the studied animals do not avoid areas close to turbines and utilize the whole area of functioning wind farms with a frequency similar to the control areas. Secondly, we expected that there is no relation between the turbine proximity and the number of tracks of these animals. The study was conducted over two winter seasons using the snow-tracking method along 100 m linear transects. In total, 583 transects were recorded. Wind farm operations may affect terrestrial animals both in wind farm interiors and in a 700-m buffer zone around the edge of turbines. The reactions of animals were species specific. Herbivorous mammals (roe deer and European hare) avoided wind farm interiors and proximity to turbines. The common pheasant showed a positive reaction to wind turbine proximity. The red fox had the most neutral response to wind turbines. Although this species visited wind farm interiors less often than the control area, there was no relation between fox track density and turbine proximity.

A robust automated detection algorithm based on support vector machine is proposed. After a preliminary signal pre-processing, geometric features specifically selected for their sensitivity to impact signals are extracted from raw vibration signal and energy distribution graph. The predictive model is formulated by training conventional support vector machine using extracted features for impact identification. Finally, the performance of the predictive model is evaluated by accuracy, precision, and recall. Results indicate a linear regression relationship between signal-to-noise ratio and model overall performance.

We describe an approach to wind energy harvesting that has the potential to resolve this disconnect by geographically distributing wind power generators in a manner that more closely mirrors the physical resource itself. To this end, technology development is focused on large arrays of small wind turbines that can harvest wind energy at low altitudes by using new concepts of biology-inspired engineering. This approach dramatically extends the reach of wind energy, as smaller wind turbines can be installed in many places that larger systems cannot, especially in built environments. Moreover, they have lower visual, acoustic, and radar signatures, and they may pose significantly less risk to birds and bats. These features can be leveraged to attain cultural acceptance and rapid adoption of this new technology, thereby enabling significantly faster achievement of state and national renewable energy targets than with existing technology alone. Favorable economics stem from an orders-of-magnitude reduction in the number of components in a new generation of simple, mass-manufacturable (even 3D-printable), vertical-axis wind turbines.

Potential types of WTN impact, including damage to wildlife physical wellbeing, vital survival mechanisms, social and reproductive processes, and habitat continuity. This article reviews the current literature on WTN effects on wildlife, and analyzes the planning guidelines relating to WTN and wildlife in three selected locales where WT infrastructure is being expanded: California, Germany, and Israel. Findings indicate that none of them have clear zoning limitations or obligatory environmental impact assessment (EIA) guidelines that require addressing the WTN effects on wildlife. However, some steps taken by planning authorities suggest potential for improvement. These include language in California planning recommendations addressing the potential effects of WTN on wildlife; a German survey of local bird species' sensitivity to noise (including a WTN section); and increasing non-obligatory recommendations that encourage distancing WTs from protected areas. The study concludes that WTN effects on wildlife could be mitigated by gathering additional scientific data on WTN impacts, mapping species presence and auditory sensitivity to provide information for planners and ad-visors, and mandating the use of better science-informed practices and technologies for WTN reduction, such as long-term monitoring, zoning, and micro-siting.",no,,67,8,8,8,22,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

However, these local populations are often subject to demographic stochasticity because of their small population size. Traditional modeling efforts such as population projection matrices do not consider this source of variation whereas individual-based models, which include demographic stochasticity, are computationally intense and lack analytical tractability. One compromise between approaches is branching process models because they accommodate demographic stochasticity and are easily calculated. These models are known within some sub-fields of probability and mathematical ecology but are not often applied in conservation biology and applied ecology. We applied branching process models to quantitatively compare and prioritize species locally vulnerable to the development of wind energy facilities. Specifically, we examined species vulnerability using branching process models for four representative species: A cave bat (a long-lived, low fecundity species), a tree bat (short-lived, moderate fecundity species), a grassland songbird (a short-lived, high fecundity species), and an eagle (a long-lived, slow maturation species). Wind turbine-induced mortality has been observed for all of these species types, raising conservation concerns. We simulated different mortality rates from wind farms while calculating local extinction probabilities. The longer-lived species types (e.g., cave bats and eagles) had much more pronounced transitions from low extinction risk to high extinction risk than short-lived species types (e.g., tree bats and grassland songbirds). High-offspring-producing species types had a much greater variability in baseline risk of extinction than the lower-offspring-producing species types. Long-lived species types may appear stable until a critical level of incidental mortality occurs. After this threshold, the risk of extirpation for a local population may rapidly increase with only minimal increases in wind mortality. Conservation biologists and wildlife managers may need to consider this mortality pattern when issuing take permits and developing monitoring protocols for wind facilities. We also describe how our branching process models may be generalized across a wider range of species for a larger assessment project and then describe how our methods may be applied to other stressors in addition to wind.",no,,67,18,18,3,69,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,DEC,2015,6,12,10.1890/ES15-00103.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES15-00103.1,,,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology

However, detection trials vary greatly in metric, duration, carcass monitoring schedule, species, number placed, state of decomposition, whether placed within or outside search areas, and other factors. We introduce a new approach for estimating fatalities by quantifying overall detection rates rather than separate rates for searcher detection error and carcass persistence, and by leaving placed and found fatality carcasses undisturbed throughout monitoring. We placed 2 fresh-frozen bird carcasses weekly at random sites within fatality search areas and on randomized days Monday-Friday at Sand Hill and Santa Clara wind projects, Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area, California, USA. To estimate detection rates, we used logit regression to fit detection outcomes on body mass, which served as an axis of similitude between placed trial carcasses and fatality finds. Adjusted carcass placement rates among species detected by searchers regressed on true placement rates with a slope of 1.0 so long as sufficient numbers of trial carcasses were placed, thus validating our approach as an unbiased estimator. Our approach generally estimated lower fatality rates than did conventional approaches, the latter of which demonstrated biases in searcher detection rates and carcass persistence rates whether based on proportion of carcasses remaining or mean days to removal. Our approach also revealed detection errors that highlight the difficulty of finding and identifying the remains of dead animals, and which warrant routine reporting. Despite averaging only a 5-day search interval on intensively grazed annual grasslands where ground visibility was usually high, our experienced fatality monitors averaged 4.3 searches/first carcass detection, failed to detect 25% of 75 species represented by placed carcasses, and misidentified carcasses to species among 44% of species detected.

While there are many species of migratory bats in North America, little is known about their seasonal movements. In terms of conservation, this is important because the bat fatalities from wind energy turbines are significant and may fluctuate seasonally. Here we describe seasonally resolved distributions for the three species that are most impacted by wind farms (Lasiurus borealis (eastern red bat), L. cinereus (hoary bat) and Lasionycteris noctivagans (silver-haired bat)) and use these distributions to infer their most likely migratory pathways. To accomplish this, we collected 2,880 occurrence points from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility over five decades in North America to model species distributions on a seasonal basis and used an ensemble approach for modeling distributions. This dataset included 1,129 data points for L. borealis, 917 for L. cinereus and 834 for L. noctivagans. The results suggest that all three species exhibit variation in distributions from north to south depending on season, with each species showing potential migratory pathways during the fall migration that follow linear features. Finally, we describe proposed migratory pathways for these three species that can be used to identify stop-over sites, assess small-scale migration and highlight areas that should be prioritized for actions to reduce the effects of wind farm mortality.",no,,96,11,11,2,24,PEERJ,PeerJ,16-Apr,2021,9,,10.7717/peerj.11177,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11177,,,23,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Given that many forest bats are threatened and that bats are important providers of ecosystem services, understanding the effects of forest management practices on their activity is fundamental for the implementation of conservation measures. Despite these important issues, studies on the effects of management practices on bats are scarce. Aims To propose management measures for coniferous production forests, to ensure sustainability of bat populations. Methods We evaluated bat species richness and activity during gestation, lactation and mating/swarming/dispersion seasons in differently managed pine stands to evaluate how vegetation structure influences those variables. Bat activity was surveyed using acoustic monitoring in 28 sampling plots within stands with distinct management records in Portugal. We also sampled arthropods using light traps to ascertain how prey availability influenced bat species richness and activity in those plots. Key results Bat species richness and activity varied along the three phenological seasons and were higher in autumn, when mating, swarming and dispersion from nurseries to hibernacula took place. Prey availability varied, but was higher during the lactation season. We hypothesise that the lower levels of bat species richness and activity registered during that period were due to a reduced availability of roosts, rather than food scarcity. Species richness was positively correlated with canopy cover and prey taxa richness, and negatively associated with dry branches cover. Total bat activity was positively correlated with tree height and prey taxa richness, and negatively associated with dry branches cover. The activity of edge-space foragers was positively associated with average tree height and prey taxa richness, while the activity of open-space foragers was negatively associated with dry branches cover. Conclusions Coniferous production forests are of great importance for bats during the mating/swarming/dispersion season. Canopy cover, dry branches cover, tree height and prey taxa richness influence bat species richness and activity as a whole, particularly the activity of open- and edge- foraging guilds. Implications Based on our results, two straightforward management actions should be implemented in coniferous production forests to increase their value for bat assemblages: the maintenance of old coniferous stands, and the cutting of dry branches at the subcanopy level.",no,,88,7,7,2,56,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

Several of the approaches used to measure detection distances are based on the researcher's experience and judgment. More recently, multiple microphones have been used to model flight path. In this study, the validity of a low-cost and simple detectability metric was tested. We hypothesize that the duration of an echolocating-bat-pass within the area of an ultrasonic bat detector is correlated with the distance of detection. Two independent datasets from a large-scale acoustic bat survey-a total of 25,786 bat-passes from 20 taxa (18 species and two genera)-were measured. We found a strong relationship between these measures of bat-pass duration and published detection distances. The advantages of bat-pass duration measures are that, for each study, experimenters easily produce their own proxy for the distance of detection. This indirect measure of the distance of detection could be mobilized to monitor the loss in microphone sensitivity used to monitor long-term population trends. Finally, the possibility of producing an index for distance of detection provides a weight for each bat species' activity when they are aggregated to produce a bat community metric, such as the widely used total activity.",no,,61,10,10,0,9,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,22-Mar,2019,11,3,10.3390/d11030047,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d11030047,,,11,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

We used three approaches to investigate the potential effects of fatalities from collisions with wind turbines on 14 raptor species for both current (106 GW) and anticipated future (241 GW) levels of installed wind energy capacity in the United States. Our goals were to identify species at relatively high vs low risk of experiencing population declines from turbine collisions and to also compare results generated from these approaches. Two of the approaches used a calculated turbine-caused mortality rate to decrement population growth, where population trends were derived either from the North American Breeding Bird Survey or from a matrix model parameterized from literature-derived demographic values. The third approach was potential biological removal, which estimates the number of fatalities that allow a population to reach and maintain its optimal sustainable population set by management objectives. Different results among the methods reveal substantial gaps in knowledge and uncertainty in both demographic parameters and species-specific estimates of fatalities from wind turbines. Our results suggest that, of the 14 species studied, those with relatively higher potential of population-level impacts from wind turbine collisions included barn owl, ferruginous hawk, golden eagle, American kestrel, and red-tailed hawk. Burrowing owl, Cooper's hawk, great horned owl, northern harrier, turkey vulture, and osprey had a relatively lower potential for population impacts, and results were not easily interpretable for merlin, prairie falcon, and Swainson's hawk. Projections of current levels of fatalities to future wind energy scenarios at 241 GW of installed capacity suggest some species could experience population declines because of turbine collisions.

However, there are also serious environmental concerns over this type of energy production due to its impacts on bats and birds. In southern Africa, bearded vultures have declined by >30% during recent decades. They are now regionally critically endangered with only around 100 active pairs remaining. This species is considered vulnerable to collision with wind turbines which are planned within their southern African range. In this study, we develop habitat use models using data obtained from 21 bearded vultures of different ages fitted with GPS tags from 2009 to 2013. We further refined these models by incorporating flying heights at risk of collision to predict important areas of use that may conflict with wind turbines. Adult and non-adult bearded vultures mostly used areas with high elevations and steep and rugged topography in the core area; adults tended to use areas in relatively close proximity to their nest sites, whereas non-adult birds used areas dispersed over the entire species range and were more likely to fly at risk-height in areas that were less used by adults. Altitudes of fixes of adults and non-adults showed that they spent 55% and 66% of their time, respectively, at heights that placed them at risk of collision. Examining the locations of two proposed wind farms in relation to our model of predicted at risk' usage suggested poor positioning. Indeed, one of these wind farms was located within the 1% of worst' (most heavily used) sites for non-adult bearded vultures suggesting that its current location should be reconsidered to reduce the impact on this vulnerable species.Synthesis and applications.

Radar based observations, successfully applied in ornithological studies, offer a promising potential, but come with challenges regarding the comparability of measurements and noise interference (ground clutter) from objects within detection range. This paper presents improvements of a commercially available inexpensive pulse radar for 3D spatial detection of bat-sized objects in onshore wind parks. A new analytical spatial detection volume model is presented incorporating calibrated radar data and landscape parameters such as clutter. Computer simulation programs to process the analytical spatial detection volume model were developed. For model calibration, the minimum signal power of the radar was experimentally determined with the radar cross section (RCS) of an artificial bat (similar toNyctalus noctula), resulting in a maximum detection range of 800 m and a corresponding RCS of 12.7 cm(2). Additionally, the spatial volume for radar detection was optimized with a clutter shielding fence (CSF). Adjusting the volume model by incorporating a theoretical model of the CSF, an extension of the detection volume by a factor of 2.5 was achieved, while the total volume of a 105 degrees horizontal angular radar image section yields 0.0105 km(3).

Hydroelectric power plants are major source of electricity in india with presently installed capacity of 41,997.42 MW as on July 31, 2015 which is 15.22% of total electricity generation in India. Hydroelectricity means production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. It is significant to optimize the revenue generated by the hydroelectric power plant to meet the implementation cost and for expansion of hydroelectric power plants. A lot of research work has been done in optimization of hydroelectric flow. In this paper, a new calibrated revenue optimization model is developed with Multi-Objective Bat Algorithm (MOBA) for hydro power plants. This model can be used to increase the revenue generated by the hydroelectric flow from the dam wih respect to given constraints in less time.

Following the principles of the umbrella species concept, if co-occurring species share similar roost-tree preferences, then management practices targeting one species may confer conservation benefits to another. We conducted a systematic review of roost-site characteristics of thirteen species inhabiting eastern temperate forests to: (1) synthesize existing knowledge across species; (2) assess niche overlap among co-occurring species; and (3) evaluate the potential for currently protected species to serve as conservation umbrellas. We performed multivariate ordination techniques to group species based on the seven most-reported roost-site characteristics, including tree species, diameter at breast height, tree health, roost type, tree height, canopy closure, and roost height. Species sorted into three roosting guilds: (1) southern wetland inhabitants; (2) foliage specialists; and (3) dead tree generalists.

Undoubtedly, for the continued development of wind farms to increase the energy capacity, wind farm locations must be carefully chosen going forward. This can be achieved not only by avoiding areas with higher bird densities but also by avoiding installations at sensitive distances from their ecologically important land-use types. Through analyses of the Euclidean distances to the different land-use types, we utilized the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to model the distance-based impacts of wind turbine locations on detected bird collisions for the frequently-hit groups of birds at WTs. Although, the predicted areas with potential collision risk in total had a small but highly dispersed expanse of similar to 2,130 km(2) across the vast 29,479 km(2) area of the federal state. Our results further segregated these assessed areas based on their different probabilities of collision thresholds (between 0 and 1) to only detect the areas with collision probabilities <.05, which were interpreted as the actual no risk areas.

Offspring in a single litter have been documented to be at different stages of development, suggesting that multiple paternity occurs. We tested the null hypothesis of genetic monogamy in red bats using 6 autosomal microsatellites and 1 X-linked microsatellite from 31 parent/offspring groups for a total of 128 bats. We sampled both pregnant females and mothers with pups that were obtained from bats submitted to departments of health in Oklahoma and Texas for rabies testing. Multiple paternity was assessed using a maximum-likelihood approach, hypothesis testing, and X-linked locus exclusion. The mean polymorphic information content of our markers was high (0.8819) and combined non-exclusion probability was low (0.00027). Results from the maximum-likelihood approach showed that 22 out of 31 (71%) parent/offspring groups consisted of half siblings, hypothesis testing rejected full sibship in 61% of parent/offspring groups, and X-linked locus exclusion suggested multiple paternity in at least 12 parent/offspring groups, rejecting our hypothesis of genetic monogamy. This frequency of multiple paternity is the highest reported thus far for any bat species. High levels of multiple paternity have the potential to impact interpretations of genetic estimates of effective population size in this species. Further, multiple paternity might be an adaptive strategy to allow for increased genetic variation and large litter size, which would be beneficial to a species threatened by population declines from wind turbines.",no,,48,4,4,0,15,J HERED,J.

The identification is based upon the average wind speed prevailing at the relevant location. For a given turbine geometry, in order to simultaneously satisfy the required power and torque characteristics over a particular range of tip speed ratio, an inverse problem is solved with the aid of golden section search method (GSSM)-based optimization algorithm to predict the required local wind speed. For this, the minimization of the sum of least square errors between the target power and torque coefficients is done with respect to some initially-guessed power and torque values. Thereafter, based on the estimated wind speed, the reconstructed power and torque characteristic curves are validated with the experimental wind tunnel data. The necessary blockage corrections have been considered during the inverse analysis for which pertinent correlations reported in the available literature are used. The variations of the estimated parameter and the pertinent objective function are studied at different iterations of the GSSM. The effect of the initial guess on the estimated value of wind velocity is also reported and it is found that a unique solution occurs for a particular set of power and torque characteristics. The present work avoids the conventional hit and trial method based nonlinear analysis along with repetitive field tests which are otherwise needed to simultaneously generate a given power and torque performance from the Savonius wind turbine. The proposed inverse method thus can be extremely useful to determine the feasible Indian geographical locations directly from any required torque and power data.",no,,29,0,0,0,1,,,,2018,,,,,,,8,"Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering

Data on the factors influencing collision risk and bird fatality are sparse and lack integration. This baseline information is critical to the development and implementation of effective mitigation measures and, therefore, is considered a priority research topic. Through an extensive literature review (we compiled 217 documents and include 111 in this paper), we identify and summarize the wide range of factors influencing bird collisions with wind turbines and the available mitigation strategies. Factors contributing to collision risk are grouped according to species characteristics (morphology, sensorial perception, phenology, behavior or abundance), site (landscape, flight paths, food availability and weather) and wind farm features (turbine type and configuration, and lighting). Bird collision risk results from complex interactions between these factors. Due to this complexity, no simple formula can be broadly applied in terms of mitigation strategies. The best mitigation option may involve a combination of more than one measure, adapted to the specificities of each site, wind farm and target species. Assessments during project development and turbine curtailment during operation have been presented as promising strategies in the literature, but need further investigation. Priority areas for future research are: (1) further development of the methodologies used to predict impacts when planning a new facility; (2) assessment of the effectiveness of existing minimization techniques; and (3) identification of new mitigation approaches.

The captured wind power values from the mathematical model and the preliminary experimental tests are compared. While the mathematical model provides a good estimation of the output power in some cases, more precise experimental tests and simulation techniques are required to improve the mathematical model in some other cases. Significant changes in the output wind speed due to pressure differences created by the surrounding environment, the tower height, and the number of nozzles are observed.

This landscape also hosts a large population of the lesser kestrel (Falco naurnanni), one of the species most threatened by collisions with wind turbines. During a ten-year period, we analysed bird mortality by recording deaths on three wind farms (WF), Cerro del Palo, Cerro Calderon and La Muela I, located in the province of Cuenca (Spain) and containing a total of 99 turbines. The aim of the study was to determine the variables associated with mortalities caused by these types of devices. Subsequently, the information obtained allowed a mitigation measure to be implemented for avoiding and minimising collisions. The procedure involved superficially tilling the soil around the base of turbines with a high collision rate. This measure was monitored for two years before and after implementation in order to compare its effectiveness, and involved making the areas around the turbines less attractive to kestrels by tilling and reducing the amount of vegetation and consequently the abundance of potential prey, mainly Orthoptera. If effective, the lack of prey would decrease the number of dead kestrels, as the birds of prey would need to search for food in other less dangerous areas (approximately 80 m away from the turbines). After monitoring the mitigation measure it was found that the number of collisions decreased by 75-100%. In fact, no collisions were registered during the two year period for all of the wind turbines with tilled surroundings. Based on these results it can be safely stated that this mitigation measure is an easy and inexpensive procedure that significantly and effectively reduces the number of kestrels that collide into wind turbines.",no,,54,7,9,1,21,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Our primary goal was to determine patterns of relative abundance for each species of bat captured over forest streams and to determine if these patterns were similar to patterns of abundance found in other types of studies, including studies of bat mortality at wind turbines. We also wanted to discern regional patterns in sex ratios that have implications for seasonal distributions and migration. Capture rates for eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) were up to 25 times greater in Aug. and Sept. than in spring or early summer. Although not significant (P = 0.063), capture rates of hoary bats (L. cinereus) peaked in both late spring and late summer. Silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) were abundant in late spring and late summer but were absent during mid summer, suggesting they migrated from the area. Sex ratios of red bats were predominately male in late spring and late summer but were dominated by females in mid summer, possibly because of increased activity of lactating females during mid summer. Female Seminole bats (L. seminolus) were only captured after Aug. 1, suggesting a seasonal geographic separation of sexes. Our results suggest that patterns of bat abundance derived from mist netting over forest streams may be similar to patterns of bat fatalities at wind turbines, communication towers, aircraft strikes, roads and patterns derived from trapping at cave entrances for many species, but it is unclear why this pattern appears ubiquitous.",no,,59,12,14,0,31,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

However, current knowledge of its land use impacts and synergies is limited by reliance on static characterizations that overlook the role of turbine technology and plant design in mediating interactions with the environment. Here, we investigate how wind technology development and innovation have shaped landscape interactions with social and ecological systems within the United States and contribute to evolving land area requirements. This work assesses trends in key land use facets of wind power using a holistic set of metrics to establish an evidence base that researchers, technology designers, land use managers, and policymakers can use in envisioning how future wind-intensive energy systems may be jointly optimized for clean energy, social, and environmental objectives. Since 2000, we find dynamic land occupancy patterns and regional trends that are driven by advancing technology and geographic factors. Though most historical U.S. wind deployment has been confined to the temperate grassland biome in the nation's interior, regional expansion has implicated diverse land use and cover types. A large percentage of the typical wind plant footprint (similar to 96% to > 99%) is not directly impacted by permanent physical infrastructure, allowing for multiple uses in the spaces between turbines. Surprisingly, turbines are commonly close to built structures. Moreover, rangeland and cropland have supported 93.4% of deployment, highlighting potential synergies with agricultural lands. Despite broadly decreasing capacity densities, offsetting technology improvements have stabilized power densities. Land use intensity, defined as the ratio of direct land usage to lifetime power generation of wind facilities, has also trended downwards. Although continued deployment on disturbed lands, and in close proximity to existing wind facilities and other infrastructure, could minimize the extent of impacts, ambitious decarbonization trajectories may predispose particular biomes to cumulative effects and risks from regional wind power saturation.

Using GPS-tracking of 16 individuals, we studied how seasonal resource selection of the capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, a forest grouse species known as sensitive to disturbance by human presence and infrastructure, was related to wind turbines and other environmental covariates in a wind farm in Sweden. During the lekking season, the probability of site-selection by capercaillic decreased with increasing turbine noise, turbine visibility and turbine shadow. During summer, we found reduced resource selection with increasing proximity to the turbines (up to 865 m), turbine density, noise, shadow and visibility. Furthermore, we found an avoidance of turbine access roads. Due to the high collinearity of the wind turbine predictors it was not possible to identify the specific mechanism causing turbine avoidance.

Meanwhile, the inconsistent relationship between China's economy and wind energy potential distribution has caused inevitable difficulties in transportation of wind power and even in grid integration. Therefore, the establishment of electrical power system integrated with local-used low-speed wind power has got considerable attention. Weibull, Rayleigh, Gamma and Lognormal probability distributions are evaluated. Then three numerical methods (NMs) - method of moment (MM), maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and least squares method (LSM), are applied to get parameter estimation in the these distributions. Additionally, another three comparison metaheuristic optimization algorithms (MOAs), including bat algorithm (BA), cuckoo search algorithm (CS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are employed as comparison methods to tune the optimal parameters. Experimental results conclude that in this case MOAs perform better than NMs. Moreover, BA-Weibull, CS-Weibull, and PSO-Weibull with only a slight difference outperform all of the other distributions. Specifically, BA-Weibull and PSO-Weibull are only slightly superior to CS-Weibull. The average wind power density, the effective wind power density, the available factor and the capacity factor of wind turbine are considered as key determinant factors in assessing the low-speed wind energy potential, which are directly influenced by the parameters in Weibull model. Moreover, the wind potential assessment in the low-speed wind areas can provide an essential technique support for further investment and development, even for further wind farm construction and economy evaluation.

Influenced by randomness characteristics of wind speed, the uncertainty in the power output of wind turbines imposes some safety and stability problems on the optimal energy management in MG. To address this problem, an expert energy management system (EEMS) considering wind power probability is developed in this study for optimal dispatching of a typical grid-connected MG. The EEMS composes of wind power probabilistic forecasting module, multi-objective optimization module and energy storage system (ESS) module. In the wind power forecasting module, wind power probabilistic forecasting based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed in this study. To improve the forecasting results, CEEMDAN, an effective signal processing method, is employed to decompose the wind power data, then, the decomposed subseries are utilized as the inputs of GPR for probabilistic forecasting. A two-step solution methodology combining an efficient and effective improved multi-objective bat algorithm (IMOBA) with fuzzy set theory (FST) is put forward to solve the optimal dispatching problems. In the first step, IMOBA is developed to optimize the energy dispatching of EEMS by minimizing both economic cost and pollutant emissions simultaneously, and obtain a well-distributed set of Pareto optimal front (POF), then, FST is employed to identify the best compromise solutions from POF. Six operational scenarios of a typical grid-connected MG based one-POF-one-day and one-POF-one-hour dispatching schemes are constructed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and provide more flexibility for decision makers. The results illustrate that EEMS can effectively schedule power generation and energy storage by considering economic cost and pollutant emission objectives simultaneously.",no,,45,15,15,3,24,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2977921,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2977921,,,17,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications

These systems can harness greater power densities at higher altitudes with lower costs of installation and energy production in comparison with those from conventional ground-based energy harnessing technologies. A Buoyant Airborne Turbine (BAT) as a flying aerostat has a horizontal axis wind turbine within its shell and can elevate up to 600m. There are a number of pertinent parameters such as BAT configurations/component dimensions or its aerodynamic characteristics that impact the system total power performance. Identifying the optimum values of these parameters by conducting theoretical and computational analysis will benefit both lab- and full-scale experiments with more accurate dimensional and aerodynamic analysis. This paper presents an analytical model for investigating the impact of a BAT system scaling and in particular the BAT shell dimensions on its power performance/coefficient. The model uses the flying conditions and BAT shell dimensions from literature to derive the system total mass as a function of BAT shell dimensions. The effect of BAT shell variations/scaling on system power coefficient and its optimum value for stable/safe system design are determined. This work provides a basis for the follow on research phases of this project that has focus on studying BAT system aerodynamic performance and its wake behavior at different scales and environmental conditions.,no,,30,0,0,0,3,,,,2018,,,,,,,9,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Engineering

In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis methodology based on a cloud bat algorithm (CBA)-kernel extreme learning machines (KELM) approach for wind turbines is proposed via combination of the multisensor data fusion technique and time-domain analysis. First, the derived method calculates the time-domain indices of raw signals, and the fused time-domain indexes dataset are obtained by the multisensor data fusion.

The effectiveness and feasibility of this proposed method are proved by adopting the datasets originated from the test rig, and it achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 96.25%.

Three clustering algorithms from two different unsupervised techniques were concerned. A total of eight validity indices were used; Davies Bouldin, mean square error, mean index adequacy, ratio of within-cluster sum-of-squares to between-cluster-variation, Dunn, Silhouette, Xie-Beni, and clustering dispersion indicator for evaluation of the unsupervised clustering algorithms in inclusive manner. Findings depicted that Bat bio inspired clustering is comparative to K-means clustering and the most effective combination of clustering algorithm and validity index was K-means and Silhouette index, respectively. Secondly, in order to achieve improved clustering of WPP, the best clustering algorithm (K-means with Silhouette index) was modified by integrating the Silhouette index as an objective function for K-means. To check the potency of the produced wind power pattern representatives during a wind system simulation, a short wind generation prediction model is presented.

Lack of such procedures is a source of serious ambiguities developing in assessment of all investment stages planning and forecasting, construction, and operation. An additional problem arises in the case of power plants located in the vicinity of Natura 2000 area, where construction projects are often obstructed on the grounds of unclear criteria concerning, among other things, the effect of acoustic phenomena on birds, bats, and other animals.

Consequently, stakeholders involved in the planning and operation of wind turbines are often in conflict when trying to reconcile both goals, namely, promoting wind energy production and protecting bats. We report the responses to an online questionnaire sent out to stakeholders to assess this conflict. More than 80% of stakeholders acknowledged the conflict between bat conservation and wind energy production; yet, the majority was confident about solutions and all desired an ecologically sustainable energy transition. All groups, except members of the wind energy sector, disagreed with the statements that wind energy production is of higher priority than biodiversity protection and that global warming is more critical than the biodiversity crisis. All groups agreed that more measures have to be taken to make wind energy production ecologically sustainable and that the society should be included to pay for the implementation of these measures. All stakeholders except for members of the wind energy sector agreed on that revenue losses from wind energy production and delays in the transition process should be acceptable to resolve the green-green dilemma. Among offered choices, most stakeholders suggested engaging in more research, improving the efficiency of energy use and implementing context dependent cut-in speed during wind turbine operation.

Wind energy is the world's fastest growing source of electricity and represents an important alternative to hydrocarbon extraction, but its effects on migratory species beyond birds and bats are not well understood. We evaluated the effects of wind-energy development on pronghorn migration, including behavior and habitat selection, to assess potential effects on connectivity and other functional benefits including stopovers. We monitored GPS-collared female pronghorn from 2010 to 2012 and 2018 to 2020 in south-central Wyoming, USA, an area with multiple wind-energy facilities in various stages of development and operation. Across all time periods, we collected 286 migration sequences from 117 individuals, including 121 spring migrations, 123 fall migrations, and 42 facultative winter migrations. While individuals continued to migrate through wind-energy facilities, pronghorn made important behavioral adjustments relative to turbines during migration. These included avoiding turbines when selecting stopover sites in spring and winter, selecting areas farther from turbines at a small scale in spring and winter, moving more quickly near turbines in spring (although pronghorn moved more slowly near turbines in the fall), and reducing fidelity to migration routes relative to wind turbines under construction in both spring and fall. For example, an increase in distance to turbine from 0 to 1 km translated to a 33% and 300% increase in the relative probability of selection for stopover sites in spring and winter, respectively.

The impact on raptors has much to do with their behavior, so careful siting of wind-energy developments to avoid areas suited to raptor breeding, foraging, or migration would reduce these effects. At established wind farms that already conflict with raptors, reduction of fatalities may be feasible by curtailment of turbines as raptors approach, and offset through mitigation of other human causes of mortality such as electrocution and poisoning, provided the relative effects can be quantified. Measurement of raptor mortality at wind farms is the subject of intense effort and study, especially where mitigation is required by law, with novel statistical approaches recently made available to improve the notoriously difficult-to-estimate mortality rates of rare and hard-to-detect species.

By combining maps of sensitive habitats and species with wind speed and land use information, we demonstrate that there is significant potential to develop wind energy in the region while avoiding significant negative impacts to wildlife.

Prior studies estimate between 10,000 and 573,000 fatal bird collisions with U.S. wind turbines annually; however, these studies do not differentiate between turbines with a monopole tower and those with a lattice tower, the former of which now comprise the vast majority of all U.S. wind turbines and the latter of which are largely being de-commissioned. We systematically derived an estimate of bird mortality for U.S. monopole turbines by applying inclusion criteria to compiled studies, identifying correlates of mortality, and utilizing a predictive model to estimate mortality along with uncertainty. Despite measures taken to increase analytical rigor, the studies we used may provide a non-random representation of all data; requiring industry reports to be made publicly available would improve understanding of wind energy impacts. Nonetheless, we estimate that between 140,000 and 328,000 (mean = 234,000) birds are killed annually by collisions with monopole turbines in the contiguous U.S. We found support for an increase in mortality with increasing turbine hub height and support for differing mortality rates among regions, with per turbine mortality lowest in the Great Plains. Evaluation of risks to birds is warranted prior to continuing a widespread shift to taller wind turbines. Regional patterns of collision risk, while not obviating the need for species-specific and local-scale assessments, may inform broad-scale decisions about wind facility siting.

These barriers may displace individuals from important habitats due to direct mortality or disturbance. Understanding animal movement patterns can help avoid such impacts and manage population level effects. Avoiding impacts and implementing mitigation strategies is difficult when movement and home range information is lacking. Impact at breeding sites may negatively affect population recruitment. The number of wind farm developments is increasing in southern Australia within the core range of the south-eastern brolga (Antigone rubicunda) population. The main threats to this wetland bird include habitat loss, chick predation and collisions with power lines and fences. Wind farms may increase collision and mortality risk, and habitat displacement but the impact is difficult to assess or mitigate, as movement patterns and home range size are unknown. We deployed 11 GPS transmitters on pre-fledged brolga chicks at breeding sites in 2010-2012, including one at a wind farm, to investigate movement and home range use of brolga chicks. Brolga chicks moved 442m on average, to and from night roost wetlands (range: 0m-1964 m). The average breeding home range was 232 ha, estimated with a Brownian bridge movement model at 95% UD, but varied greatly between individuals (70 ha-523 ha). Brolgas used either single or multiple wetlands, and those using multiple wetlands either switched between them or relocated permanently. Information from this study can be used to design turbine-free buffers at brolga breeding sites and to manage breeding wetlands. (c) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Fortunately, there are some signs of recovery; for instance, of the 11 species monitored in the UK, population trends of five are increasing. The drivers of past losses and recent trends are unclear; identifying them will enable targeted conservation strategies to support further recovery. We review the evidence linking proposed drivers to impacts on bat populations in Europe, using the results of a previous cross-taxa semi-quantitative assessment as a framework. Broadly, the drivers reviewed relate to land-use practices, climate change, pollution, development and infrastructure, and human disturbance. We highlight where evidence gaps or conflicts present barriers to successful conservation and review emerging opportunities to address these gaps. We find that the relative importance or impacts of the potential drivers of bat population change are not well understood or quantified, with conflicting evidence in many cases. To close key gaps in the evidence for responses of bat populations to environmental change, future studies should focus on the impacts of climate change, urbanisation, offshore wind turbines, and water pollution, as well as on mitigation measures and the synergistic effects of putative drivers.

We were especially interested in assessing the mortality rates related with the interplay between habitat loss due to socioecological change and increasing wind power using alternative strategies: adding wind turbines or substituting existing wind turbines by more powerful ones, i.e. repowering. Several known aspects related with the risk of collision of A. arvensis with wind turbines were considered, particularly regarding the male habitat selection and behaviour displayed throughout the breeding season. By simulating a sequential contraction of suitable habitat for the species, we found a substantial increase in the breeding territories superimposed to the wind farm influence zone. In these conditions males' relative mortality was predicted to suffer significant increases. For equivalent wind power, adding wind turbines produced significant increases in the males' relative mortality, whereas repowering didn't. Based on our findings we propose repowering as a defensible strategy to increase wind energy production without increasing A. arvensis collision risk. We highlight that this strategy might also benefit other vulnerable bird and bat species associated with declining habitats of mountain ridges in the Mediterranean region.",no,,154,5,6,0,30,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Automated processing makes continuous monitoring over extended periods of time feasible, and maximizes the information provided by video. This is especially important for collecting data in remote locations that are difficult for human observers to access, such as proposed offshore wind turbine sites. We developed new processing algorithms for single camera thermal video that automate the extraction of two-dimensional bird and bat flight tracks, and that characterize the extracted tracks to support animal identification and behavior inference. The algorithms consist of video peak store followed by background masking and perceptual grouping to extract flight tracks. The extracted tracks are automatically quantified in terms that could then be used to infer animal taxonomy and possibly behavior, as described in the companion article from Cullinan, et al. (Classification of birds and bats using flight tracks. Ecological Informatics, 27:55-63]. The developed automated processing was evaluated using six video clips containing a total of 184 flight tracks. The detection rate was 81% and the false positive rate was 17%. In addition to describing the details of the algorithms, we suggest models for interpreting thermal imaging information. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Pipistrellus nathusii occurred at all sites (north to 61 degrees N in Finland), while the other species were scarcer, particularly at the northernmost sites. The status of the recorded individuals is unknown. However, the activity most likely was of migrating individuals or individuals on migration stopover, because very few observations were made during the maternity period. Spring activity occurred predominantly in May, with the median observation date of P. nathusii 20 days earlier in the south (Germany) than in the north (Finland). Autumn migration was observed throughout August and September and activity that may or may not indicate migration was also observed in October and November. The median date of such activity in autumn usually occurred in September and without any significant difference in timing in relation to latitude. Migratory bats in the Baltic area apparently move on a broad front in most cases. The estimated speed of migration for P. nathusii in spring was 55 km/day.

To mitigate population declines, the habitat requirements of species of concern must be established. Assessments that predict habitat quality based upon landscape features can aid species management over large areas. Roosts are critical habitat for many bat species including the endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) and the threatened northern long-eared bat (M. septentrionalis). While much is known about the microhabitat requirements of roosts, translating such knowledge into landscape-level management is difficult. Our goal was to determine the landscape-scale environmental variables necessary to predict roost occupancy for both species. Using MaxLike, a presence-only occupancy modeling approach, with known roost sites, we identified factors associated with roosting habitat. Spatially independent roost locations were particularly limited for northern long-eared bats resulting in differences in study areas and sample sizes between the two species. Occupancy of Indiana bat roosts was greatest in areas with > 80 % local forest cover within broader landscapes (1 km) with < 40 % forest, < 1 km of perennial streams but > 1 km from intermittent streams and in areas with poor foraging habitat. Northern long-eared roost occupancy was greatest in areas with > 80 % regional but fragmented forest cover with greater forest edge approximately 4 km from the nearest major road.

This paper aims to propose a supplementary damping controller (SDC) based on the HVDC to improve not only power system dynamic stability but also energy conversion efficiency and torsional vibration damping in the wind power plants (WPPs). When the WPPs are working in power control mode, the active power is set to its reference value, which is extracted from power-speed curve. This paper shows that torsional oscillations associated with the poorly torsional modes can be affected by different operating regions of the power-speed curve of WPP. Therefore, it is essential to employ an SDC to have the optimum energy conversion efficiency in the wind turbine and the most dynamic stability margin in the power system. The SDC is designed using a fractional-order PID controller (FOPID) based on the multiobjective bat-genetic algorithm (MOBGA). The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy effectively works in minimizing the torsional and electromechanical oscillations in power system and optimizing the energy conversion efficiency in the wind turbine.",no,,31,0,0,1,5,J ELECTR COMPUT ENG,J.

In this paper, the impact of three functioning wind farms on terrestrial small mammal communities (rodents and shrews) and the population parameters of the most abundant species were studied. The study was carried out in southeastern Poland within the foothills of the Outer Western Carpathians. Small mammals were captured at 12 sites around wind turbines and at 12 control sites. In total, from 1200 trap-days, 885 individuals of 14 studied mammal species were captured. There was no difference in the characteristics of communities of small mammals near wind turbines and within control sites; i.e. these types of sites were inhabited by a similar number of species of similar abundance, similar species composition, species diversity (H' index) and species evenness (J') (Pielou's index). For the two species with the highest proportion in the communities (Apodemus agrarius and Microtus arvalis), the parameters of their populations (mean body mass, sex ratio, the proportion of adult individuals and the proportion of reproductive female) were analysed. In both species, none of the analysed parameters differed significantly between sites in the vicinity of turbines and control sites.

The objective of this monitoring is to estimate abundance of a super-population of carcasses that entered the area within a designated period of time. By definition, the population is not closed and carcasses can enter as they are killed through collision with turbines, and leave as they are removed by scavengers or decompose to a point where they are not recognizable. In addition, the population is not inherently mobile, but can only change location through some external force. A focus on number of animal carcasses comprising the super-population, combined with peculiar traits that resist classic assumptions, distinguish fatality estimation at wind-power facilities from more classic abundance estimates that can be addressed through mark-recapture techniques or other well-known abundance estimators. We review the available methods to estimate the super-population of carcasses at wind power facilities. We discuss the role of these estimates in determining appropriate levels of minimization and mitigation of impacts to individual species of concern. We discuss the potential to extrapolate these measurements to reflect the cumulative effect of the industry on individual species.

Some fraction of carcasses inevitably lie outside the search plots, and accurate mortality estimation requires accounting for those carcasses using models to extrapolate from searched to unsearched areas. Such models should account for variation in carcass density with distance, and ideally also for variation with direction (anisotropy). We compare five methods of accounting for carcasses that land outside the searched area (ratio, weighted distribution, non-parametric, and two generalized linear models (glm)) by simulating spatial arrival patterns and the detection process to mimic observations which result from surveying only, or primarily, roads and pads (R&P) and applying the five methods. Simulations vary R&P configurations, spatial carcass distributions (isotropic and anisotropic), and per turbine fatality rates. Our results suggest that the ratio method is less accurate with higher variation relative to the other four methods which all perform similarly under isotropy.

Brown planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens) are known to migrate at high altitude and can cause severe damage and economic loss over a large area. However, we lack evidence whether this bat species also forage at high altitudes. This study investigated the stratification in foraging activity of C. plicatus at approximately 0, 100, and 200 m above ground level by using a helium-filled balloon-kite. The activity of C. plicatus aloft (100m and 200m) on average was six to twelve times higher than that close to the ground. Peak activity corresponded with the top of the nocturnal stable boundary layer, which is also the layer of maximum temperature and wind speed. Nilaparvata lugens has been found flying at the altitude where peak bat foraging activity occurs, which suggests that C. plicatus actively follows these migratory insects in the air. Thus, C. plicatus bats potentially play an important role in insect pest suppression in the areas they inhabit as well as at the landscape scale. However, the height of peak activity also corresponds with the height of wind turbine blades, thus, such turbines may pose a serious threat to the species.

Direct impacts of wind energy include bird and bat collisions with turbines whereas indirect impacts include changes in wildlife habitat and behavior. Although many species may withstand these effects, species that are long-lived with low rates of reproduction, have specialized habitat preferences, or are attracted to turbines may be more prone to declines in population abundance. We developed a prioritization system to identify the avian species most likely to experience population declines from wind facilities based on their current conservation status and their expected risk from turbines. We developed 3 metrics of turbine risk that incorporate data on collision fatalities at wind facilities, population size, life history, species' distributions relative to turbine locations, number of suitable habitat types, and species' conservation status. We calculated at least 1 measure of turbine risk for 428 avian species that breed in the United States. We then simulated 100,000 random sets of cutoff criteria (i.e., the metric values used to assign species to different priority categories) for each turbine risk metric and for conservation status. For each set of criteria, we assigned each species a priority score and calculated the average priority score across all sets of criteria. Our prioritization system highlights both species that could potentially experience population decline caused by wind energy and species at low risk of population decline. For instance, several birds of prey, such as the long-eared owl, ferruginous hawk, Swainson's hawk, and golden eagle, were at relatively high risk of population decline across a wide variety of cutoff values, whereas many passerines were at relatively low risk of decline.

The Strait of Gibraltar (southern Spain) has long been recognized as the most important bottleneck in western Europe for soaring bird migration. Moreover, this area is within one of the most important potential areas for wind energy generation in Spain. Here, we examine monthly migratory soaring bird abundance in relation to long-term avian mortality rates at 21 wind farms located near the Strait of Gibraltar using zero-inflated hurdle negative binomial and gamma models. Best fit models included an effect of season in the collision mortality rates and in the proportion of adult individuals within the total deaths. However, monthly bird abundance was not directly related to the number of fatalities over the year. The accumulated fatalities during autumn migration constitute a small percentage (1%) of the total migrating population size. Moreover, mortality peak during autumn migration is largely attributable to juvenile birds. In contrast, the number of fatalities coinciding with the breeding period constitutes a substantial proportion (6%) of the local population, and it involved substantial losses among adult birds. Our results show that wind farms probably have an individually low impact on the migratory population of soaring birds.

The proposed hybrid system is designed to integrate a biomass system with a photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT) and battery storage system (Bat). Four different cases are proposed and compared for analyzing and optimizing. The first case is a configuration of PV and WT with a biomass system and battery bank. The second case is the integration of PV with a biomass system and battery bank. The third case is WT integrated with biomass and a battery bank, and the fourth case is a conventional PV, WT, and battery bank as the main storage unit. The optimization is designed to reduce component oversizing and ensure the dependable control of power supplies with the objective function of reducing the levelized cost of energy and loss of power supply probability. Four optimization algorithms, namely Heap-based optimizer (HBO), Franklin's and Coulomb's algorithm (CFA), the Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA), and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) are utilized and compared with each other to ensure that all load demand is met at the lowest energy cost (COE) for the proposed hybrid system. The obtained results revealed that the HBO has achieved the best optimal solution for the suggested hybrid system for case one and two, with the minimum COE 0.121171 and 0.1311804 $/kWh, respectively, and with net present cost (NPC) of $3,559,143 and $3,853,160, respectively.

Following a similar review for solar energy we identified known and potential effects due to construction and eventual decommissioning of wind energy facilities. Many of the effects are similar and include direct mortality, environmental impacts of destruction and modification of habitat including impacts of roads, and offsite impacts related to construction material acquisition, processing and transportation. Known and potential effects due to operation and maintenance of facilities include habitat fragmentation and barriers to gene flow, as well as effects due to noise, vibration and shadow flicker, electromagnetic field generation, macro- and micro-climate change, predator attraction, and increased fire risk. The scarcity of before-after-control-impact studies hinders the ability to rigorously quantify the effects of USWEDO on non-volant wildlife.

The BES has several benefits and advantages in the MG-based applications such as short term power supply, power quality improvement, facilitating integration of RES, ancillary service and arbitrage. This paper presents the cost-based formulation to determine the optimal size of the BES in the operation management of MG. Also, some restrictions, i.e. power capacity of Distributed Generators (DGs), power and energy capacity of BES, charge/discharge efficiency of BES, operating reserve and load demand satisfaction should be considered as well. The suggested problem is a complicated optimization problem, the complexity of which is increased by considering the above constraints. Therefore, a robust and strong optimization algorithm is required to solve it. Herein, this paper proposes a new evolutionary technique named improved bat algorithm that is used for developing corrective strategies and to perform least cost dispatches.

While wind power is a proven, sustainable energy source, siting can be challenging. Identifying potential sites for wind turbines is a significant step in renewable energy resource planning. Wind turbine site suitability is primarily dependent upon location wind speed along with other economical, environmental and social factors. It is critical to arrive at robust wind farm decision to improve public acceptance, preserve the environment, and assure economic viability. This study provides a modelling approach that incorporates expert opinions of siting criteria in determining potential locations for wind farms in the state of West Virginia. The research involved a two-stage holistic approach: (1) a multi-criteria decision analysis-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and (2) Geographic Information System assessment of sites. This research builds upon previous studies and contributes to the literature by incorporating two important components: (1) inclusion of critical wildlife habitat for birds and bats as an elimination criterion within the AHP, and (2) the participation by wind power experts in the AHP decision-making process for the utility-scale wind farm suitability modeling. By incorporating expert opinions with weighing of ten siting factors, about 70,000 hectares of land are identified as 'highly suitable' for wind power development throughout the state of West Virginia.

Here we investigate the acoustics of wingbeats in birds and bats by co-registering wing-movement in natural flight with acoustic noise. To understand the relationships between wing movement and acoustics, we conducted additional acoustic measurements of single moving wings and other moving surfaces with accurately tracked motion paths. We found a correlation between wing-surface area and the sound pressure level of wingbeats; with bats tending to produce lower levels than birds. Measuring moving wings in isolation showed that a downstroke toward a microphone causes negative sound pressure that flips back into positive pressure at the reversal to the upstroke. The flip back to positive pressure is unrelated to the action of the upstroke, but occurs when the downward motion is halted. If the microphone is positioned above the downward wingbeat, then sound pressure instead quickly rises during the downward motion of the wing. The phase pattern of the impulse created by the wingbeat varies systematically with recording-angle. The curvature of the wing appears to be a determinant of the average frequency of the acoustic impulse. Our findings can be used to predict the acoustics of smaller flying animals where repetition pitch of similar underlying impulses, repeated at much higher wingbeat-rates become dominant.",no,,25,5,5,1,11,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

Protected-area networks have tremendous potential to support coordinated resource protection, disease surveillance, and population monitoring that could become a cornerstone of 21st-century bat conservation. To motivate this idea, we develop a macroecological perspective about bat diversity and associated conservation challenges and opportunities on U.S. National Park Service (NPS) lands. We compared occurrence records from parks against published range maps. Only 55 (19%) of parks reported as present >= 90% of the bat species expected based on range maps, highlighting the information-gap challenge. Discrepancies suggest substantial under-reporting and under-sampling of bats on NPS lands; inadequate range maps and habitat specificity are implicated for some species. Despite these discrepancies, 50 species, including several range-restricted and endangered taxa, were reported in at least one park unit, including those in the Caribbean and tropical Pacific. Species richness increased with park area at a rate (z) of similar to 0.1, a pattern confounded by covariation with latitude, elevation, and habitat. When accounting for these factors, richness decreased predictably at higher latitudes and increased at mid-elevations and with greater numbers of keystone underground habitat structures (caves and mines), reflecting a strong species-energy relationship. The inclusion of covariates that represented percentage of natural vs. human-modified (converted) landscapes and elevation range-a proxy for environmental heterogeneity-was uninformative. White-nose syndrome (WNS) presents a tremendous challenge to the NPS: All 12 species currently known to be affected by the disease or to host the causal fungus are represented in the NPS system. One hundred and twenty-seven NPS parks are in counties currently or likely to become WNS-positive by 2026. All parks are expected to experience increasing temperatures in coming decades; forecasted climate change velocity is particularly high (>1 SD) for 50 parks. Seventeen parks are in the vicinity of high (>1 SD) wind turbine density. Based on these biogeographic patterns, we suggest ways to prioritize NPS parks for additional inventories, monitoring, and resource protection. Our results demonstrate how macroecology and bioinformatics together can guide strategic conservation capacity-building among protected areas.",no,,89,9,9,3,44,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,NOV,2016,7,11,10.1002/ecs2.1576,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1576,,,21,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology

The hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) is highly migratory and ranges farther across North America than any other wild mammal. Despite the ecological importance of this species as a major insect predator, and the particular susceptibility of lasiurine bats to wind turbine strikes, our understanding of hoary bat ecology, physiology, and behavior remains poor. Methods: To better understand adaptive evolution in this lineage, we used whole-genome sequencing to identify protein-coding sequence and explore signatures of positive selection. Gene models were predicted with Maker and compared to seven well-annotated and phylogenetically representative species. Evolutionary rate analysis was performed with PAML. Results: Of 9,447 single-copy orthologous groups that met evaluation criteria, 150 genes had a significant excess of nonsynonymous substitutions along the L. cinereus branch (P < 0.001 after manual review of alignments). Selected genes as a group had biased expression, most strongly in thymus tissue. We identified 23 selected genes with reported immune functions as well as a divergent paralog of Steepl within suborder Yangochiroptera. Seventeen genes had roles in lipid and glucose metabolic pathways, partially overlapping with 15 mitochondrion-associated genes; these adaptations may reflect the metabolic challenges of hibernation, long-distance migration, and seasonal variation in prey abundance. The genomic distribution of positively selected genes differed significantly from background expectation by discrete Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (P < 0.001). Remarkably, the top three physical clusters all coincided with islands of conserved synteny predating Mammalia, the largest of which shares synteny with the human cat-eye critical region (CECR) on 22q11. This observation coupled with the expansion of a novel Tbx1-like gene family may indicate evolutionary innovation during pharyngeal arch development: both the CECR and Tbx1 cause dosage-dependent congenital abnormalities in thymus, heart, and head, and craniodysmorphy is associated with human orthologs of other positively selected genes as well.",no,,188,0,0,3,12,PEERJ,PeerJ,17-Mar,2022,10,,10.7717/peerj.13130,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13130,,,39,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

In the southeastern US in particular, the recent arrival of white-nose syndrome and changes in landscape composition and configuration have driven shifts in bat species populations and distributions. Effective management strategies which address these large-scale, community-level threats require landscape-scale analyses. Our objective was to model the relationship between ecoregional and landscape factors and occupancy by all bat species in South Carolina, USA, during summer. We conducted acoustic surveys from mid-May through July 2015 and 2016 and evaluated temporally dynamic occupancy models for eight bat species or species groups at the 100 km(2) level. We found significant effects of landscape factors such as ecoregion and forest edge density for three species, but habitat condition effects were not statistically significant for five other species. Thus, for some species, site-use analyses may be more appropriate than larger scale occupancy analyses. However, our occupancy predictions generally matched statewide historical distributions for all species, suggesting our approach could be useful for monitoring landscape-level trends in bat species. Thus, while our scale of study was likely too coarse for assessing fine-scale habitat associations for all bat species, our findings can improve future monitoring efforts, inform conservation priorities, and guide subsequent landscape-scale studies for bat species and community-level responses to global change.",no,,73,8,8,1,39,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,8-Nov,2018,13,11,10.1371/journal.pone.0206857,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206857,,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Mexican free-tailed bats provide ecosystem services such as insect pest-suppression in agricultural areas and recreational viewing opportunities, and may be threatened by climate change and development of wind energy. We evaluated each roost based on five attributes: the maternity roost's contribution to population viability, the pest suppression ecosystem services to the surrounding area provided by the bats residing in the roost, the ecotourism value of the roost, the risks posed to each roost structure, and the risks posed to the population of bats residing in each roost. We compared several scenarios that prioritized these attributes differently, hypothesizing that the set of roosts with the highest rankings would vary according to the conservation scenario.

However, previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of wind farms on flying fauna (i.e., birds and bats) or climate change separately from communities or ecosystems, and little attention has been paid to vegetation during wind farm operation. Furthermore, few studies have referred to vulnerable ecosystems with low biomass and biodiversity. In this research, a field study was conducted to investigate the effects of wind farms on the individual traits, community structures and ecosystem functions of Gobi Desert ecosystems. The effects were measured by comparing interfering areas (IAs, located between 40 m and 90 m in the downstream direction of the wind turbine) with non-interfering areas (NIAs, located over 200 m from the wind turbine matrixes). The results showed that (1) plant individuals in IAs were less stressed and in better physiological states than those in NIAs; (2) for community structures, IA plants tended to be shorter and denser and had a higher coverage condition than that of NIA plants; and (3) ecosystem functions in IAs were significantly improved due to the existence of shrubs and higher biomass.

This optimization strategy is tailored toward instances where a closed-form expression for the system dynamic response is unobtainable and simulations or experiments are necessary. Specifically, Bayesian optimization, which is a data-driven technique for finding the optimum of an unknown and expensive-to-evaluate objective function, is employed to solve a nested optimization problem. The underlying objective function is modeled by a Gaussian process (GP); then, Bayesian optimization utilizes the predictive uncertainty information from the GP to determine the best subsequent control or plant parameters. The proposed framework differs from the majority of codesign literature where there exists a closedform model of the system dynamics. Furthermore, we utilize the idea of batch Bayesian optimization at the plant optimization level to generate a set of plant designs at each iteration of the overall optimization process, recognizing that there will exist economies of scale in running multiple experiments in each iteration of the plant design process. We validate the proposed framework for Altaeros' buoyant airborne turbine (BAT).

For example, habitat degradation at renewable energy production sites may affect the persistence of wildlife populations. We assessed the effects of wind farms in the San Gorgonio Wind Resource Area near Palm Springs, California, 2013-2015, on local populations of the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana). The side-blotched lizard is a common and ubiquitous desert reptile that is a major consumer of invertebrates and, in turn, represents a key prey base for many avian, reptilian, and mammalian predators. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture methods to compare a comprehensive set of population-level vital signs (i.e., abundance, population growth rate, survival, recruitment, body condition, age structure, activity area size, movement rates) among populations at 4 wind farms and at 5 reference areas. Although our models indicate that wind facilities have a weak negative effect on side-blotched lizard survival, our overall results suggest that wind farms do not substantially influence the demography or behavior of these small lizards. Population response to general anthropogenic disturbance (quantified as an index of road type and density) was more pronounced, with lower population growth rates, adult-skewed age structure, and reduced body condition at highly disturbed wind farm and reference sites. We therefore conclude that wind-power facilities can support healthy populations of side-blotched lizards, indicating that wind energy development is compatible with a native Mojave Desert species. However, our results show that anthropogenic disturbance, as measured by the type and density of roadways, has a negative effect on lizard populations, and should be carefully planned whether associated with energy development or not.

In the European countries, several wind energy projects encounter objections and protests from the neighbouring population of wind farm sites. This study aims to understand the drivers of this obstructive behaviour suggesting the main issues to discuss for adequate regulatory strategies to promote at community level. The novelty of this study is that for the first time, qualitative - Focus Group - and quantitative - Optimized-Analytic Hierarchy Process and Monte Carlo simulation - approaches, are used synergistically to support the view of a social acceptance to wind energy. In particular, the analysis focuses on: i) People's perception of wind energy in a context of public engagement; ii) Assessment of the factors affecting a wind farm; iii) Differences occurring in people's perception living nearby or far from wind farms. Main results suggest a general critical attitude due to misinformation and lack of transparency of governmental institutions.

The GA-PSO is one of the most powerful single-objective optimization algorithms. In the other hand, the multi-objective PSO (MOPSO) can solve the optimization problems considering all objectives without transforming them. Minimizing the total present cost including initial cost, operation and maintenance cost, and replacement cost with satisfying the load demand is the main goal of this study. In this optimization problem, the considered reliability factor is a loss of power supply probability, which specifies the subtraction of the load power and generated power. The wind velocity, solar irradiance, and load demand are simulated in 12 months of a year by the HOMER software for a suburbs of Tehran. Then, the optimal size of PV and WT are obtained with both GA-PSO and MOPSO methods, and compared with the HOMER results. At last, the strengths and weaknesses of each method are explained.

Andaman and Nicobar(A&N) Island of India have no main grid. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) Pro software is used to study feasibility of power generation using various sources. Study incorporating tidal plant with wind turbine and Bio-DG in micro grid is considered first time for an Indian scenario as per authors' knowledge with applica-tion of various DS and energy storage technologies. The superiority of LIB over LAB and MES is proved in this study. Wind/Bio-DG /tidal/LIB have relatively least net present cost(NPC), cost of energy (COE) of $1.30M and $0.263, respectively among five energy storage devices using CC dispatch strategy compared to other two strategies. It is investigated that LIB uses only 250 units of batteries, which is 46% less than total utilized LAB units for catering same load. In terms of expected lifespan, energy losses, energy pro-duction and state of charge (SOC), performance of LIB are superior to LAB.

This system is part of a new class of wind energy system known as Airborne wind energy systems (AWES). To inform the reader, a brief review of the current control architecture for different types of AWES is presented. The paper then evaluates the control architecture for the Altaeros system and illustrates through a frequency domain analysis the impact that operating conditions will have on movement in roll, pitch and altitude. The primary contribution of this paper rests in the design of a multiloop novel adaptive low level PD controller that is developed from linearized models covering the full operating envelope. PD gains are adapted as a function of the system operating conditions and tuned as a function of the multi-loop bandwidth. As such it is shown that the control design varies with wind conditions and so facilitates the need for this adaptive approach. This work illustrates that a model free multiloop controller can be achieved without the need for extensive calibration parameters as in the classic LQR approach and demonstrates the merits of simplified PD tuning strategies when faced with complex multivariable problems.",no,,9,1,1,0,0,P AMER CONTR CONF,,,2015,,,,,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering

In two global surveys with bat experts before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed their (i) threat perceptions, emotions towards bats and social trust in decision makers and (ii) the predictive potential of emotions, social trust and socio-demographic variables on threat perceptions. We also discuss (iii) the potential influence of the pandemic on threat perception and antecedents (emotions and social trust). We received 495 responses from 65 countries in September 2019 and 320 responses in June 2020 from 77 countries. We identified three major threat categories (indirect, direct and prejudice). Comparing threat perception, emotions and social trust between both surveys, we found that indirect threats (e.g., habitat modification) were considered as crucial, yet less so during the pandemic. During the pandemic, experts rated indirect threats lower and the perceived threat through prejudice (e.g., myths) higher than before the pandemic. During the pandemic, bat experts also expressed more compassion and sadness related to bats and trust in researchers and NGOs, but less trust in laypeople than before the pandemic. Emotions were particularly important predictors for threats through prejudice besides social trust. Socio-demographic variables (e.g., cultural and professional background) had predictive potential predominantly for direct threats (e.g., hunting and trade, wind turbines) and threats through prejudice. Our study highlights the role of emotions and social trust on threat perception among bat experts who remained relatively invisible during the pandemic despite their key role for bat conservation.

To date, induction-based turbines form the mainstay of this effort, but turbines are noisy, perceived as unattractive, a potential hazard to bats and birds, and their height hampers deployment in residential settings. Several groups have proposed that artificial plants containing piezoelectric elements may harvest wind energy sufficient to contribute to a carbon-neutral energy economy. Here we measured energy conversion by cottonwood-inspired piezoelectric leaves, and by a vertical flapping stalk-the most efficient piezo-leaf previously reported. We emulated cottonwood for its unusually ordered, periodic flutter, properties conducive to piezo excitation. Integrated over 0 degrees-90 degrees (azimuthal) of incident airflow, cottonwood mimics outperformed the vertical flapping stalk, but they produced << daW per conceptualized tree. In contrast, a modest-sized cottonwood tree may dissipate similar to 80 W via leaf motion alone. A major limitation of piezo-transduction is charge generation, which scales with capacitance (area). We thus tested a rudimentary, cattail-inspired leaf with stacked elements wired in parallel. Power increased systematically with capacitance as expected, but extrapolation to acre-sized assemblages predicts << daW. Although our results suggest that present piezoelectric materials will not harvest mid-range power from botanic mimics of convenient size, recent developments in electrostriction and triboelectric systems may offer more fertile ground to further explore this concept.",no,,29,9,9,0,43,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,13-Jan,2017,12,1,10.1371/journal.pone.0170022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0170022,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

However, there are ecological challenges related to wind energy generation, including collisions of wildlife with turbines. Lack of rigor, and variation in study design, together limit efforts to understand the broad-scale effects of wind power infrastructure on wildlife populations. It is not clear, however, whether these types of limitations apply to groups of birds such as raptors that are particularly vulnerable to negative effects of wind energy. We reviewed 672 peer-reviewed publications, unpublished reports, and citations from 321 wind facilities in 12 countries to evaluate methods used to monitor and mitigate for wind facility impacts on raptors. Most reports that included raptor monitoring (86 %, n = 461) only conducted post-construction monitoring for raptor fatalities, while few (12 %; n = 65) estimated pre -construction raptor use. Only 27 % of facilities (n = 62) provided estimates of fatalities or raptor use across multiple construction phases, and the percentage of facilities with data available from multiple construction periods has not changed over time. A formal experimental study design was incorporated into surveys at only 29 % of facilities. Finally, mitigation practices to reduce impacts on raptors were only reported at 23 % of facilities. Our results suggest that rigorous data collection on wind energy impacts to raptors is rare, and that mitigation of detrimental effects is seldom reported.

B,"Logan, J; Kaplan, SM","WIND POWER IN THE UNITED STATES: TECHNOLOGY, ECONOMIC, AND POLICY ISSUES","WIND POWER: TECHNOLOGY, ECONOMICS AND POLICIES",English,Article; Book Chapter,,,"Rising energy prices and concern over greenhouse gas emissions have focused congressional attention on energy alternatives, including wind power. Although wind power currently provides only about 1% of U.S. electricity needs, it is growing more rapidly than any other energy source. In 2007, over 5,000 megawatts of new wind generating capacity were installed in the United States, second only to new natural gas-fired generating capacity. Wind power has become mainstream in many regions of the country, and is no longer considered an alternative energy source. Wind energy has become increasingly competitive with other power generation options. Wind technology has improved significantly over the past two decades. CRS analysis presented here shows that wind energy still depends on federal tax incentives to compete, but that key uncertainties like climate policy, fossil fuel prices, and technology progress could dominate future cost competitiveness. A key challenge for wind energy is that electricity production depends on when winds blow rather than when consumers need power. Wind's variability can create added expenses and complexity in balancing Supply and demand on the grid. Recent studies imply that these integration costs do not become significant (5-10% of wholesale prices) until wind turbines account for 15-30% of the capacity in a given control area. Another concern is that new transmission infrastructure will be required to send the wind-generated power to demand centers. Building new lines can be expensive and time-consuming, and there are debates over how construction costs should be allocated among end-users and which pricing methodologies are best. Opposition to wind power arises for environmental, aesthetic, or aviation security reasons. New public-private partnerships have been established to address more comprehensively problems with avian (bird and bat) deaths resulting from wind farms. Some stakeholders oppose the construction of wind plants for visual reasons, especially in pristine or highly-valued areas. A debate over the potential for wind turbines to interfere with aviation radar emerged in 2006, but most experts believe any possible problems are economically and technically manageable. Federal wind power policy has centered primarily on the production tax credit (PTC), a business incentive to operate wind facilities. The PTC is set to expire on December 31, 2008. Analysts and wind industry representatives argue that the on- again off-again nature of the PTC is inefficient and leads to higher costs for the industry. While there is often bipartisan support for the PTC in Congress, debate centers more fundamentally on how to offset its revenue losses. A federal renewable portfolio standard - which would mandate wind power levels - was rejected in the Senate in late 2007; its future is uncertain. If wind is to Supply Lip to 20% of the nation's power by 2030, as suggested by a recent U.S. Department of Energy report, additional federal policies will likely be required to overcome barriers, and ensure development of an efficient wind market.",no,,26,10,10,0,10,,,,2008,,,,,,,46,Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Energy & Fuels; Public Administration

This issue is threatening the avian life especially migratory birds and bats. Avian monitoring techniques can be used to detect bird and bats, assess their activity, and make intelligent decision for construction of wind farms. In this paper, an IR monitoring approach is used for monitoring birds and bats in an area potential for future construction of wind turbines. As there is no a priori database of images for local birds/bats, clustering is used as an effective technique to group different avian categories. Fuzzy C Means is developed in this application to cluster the targets into birds, bats, and insects groups. The results are then compared with a hard Ant Clustering Algorithm.

We describe how alterations can be assessed as 'hazards' to wildlife through a sequence of three steps: diagnosing the means by which the hazard acts on individual organisms at risk; estimating the fitness cost of the hazard to those individuals and the rate at which that cost occurs; and translating that cost rate into a demographic cost by identifying the relevant demographically-closed population. We exploit the conservation-oriented literature on wind farms to illustrate this conceptual scheme. For wind farms, the third component has received less attention than the first two, which suggests it is the most challenging of the three components. A wind farm provides an example of a 'spatially localized hazard', i.e., a discrete alteration of landscape hazardous to some population but of which there are some individuals that do not interact directly with the hazard themselves but nevertheless suffer a reduction in fitness in terms of their contribution to the next generation. Spatially localized hazards are identified via the third component of the scheme and are of particular conservation concern as, by their nature, their depredations on wildlife may be underestimated without an appropriate population-level estimation of the demographic cost of the hazard.",no,,64,4,4,3,23,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

With increased detection methods, many organizations and agencies are creating habitat suitability models (HSMs) to identify critical habitats and prioritize conservation measures. However, multiple occurrence data types are used independently to create these HSMs with little understanding of how biases inherent to those data might impact HSM efficacy. We sought to understand how different data types can influence HSMs using three bat species (Lasiurus borealis, Lasiurus cinereus, and Perimyotis subflavus). We compared the overlap of models created from passive-only (acoustics), active-only (mist-netting and wind turbine mortalities), and combined occurrences to identify the effect of multiple data types and detection bias. For each species, the active-only models had the highest discriminatory ability to tell occurrence from background points and for two of the three species, active-only models preformed best at maximizing the discrimination between presence and absence values. By comparing the niche overlaps of HSMs between data types, we found a high amount of variation with no species having over 45% overlap between the models. Passive models showed more suitable habitat in agricultural lands, while active models showed higher suitability in forested land, reflecting sampling bias. Overall, our results emphasize the need to carefully consider the influences of detection and survey biases on modeling, especially when combining multiple data types or using single data types to inform management interventions. Biases from sampling, behavior at the time of detection, false positive rates, and species life history intertwine to create striking differences among models. The final model output should consider biases of each detection type, particularly when the goal is to inform management decisions, as one data type may support very different management strategies than another.",no,,100,0,0,4,4,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Environmental concerns have focused on effects on birds,and in this paper we briefly review these effects in the context of methods for assessing preconstruction risk and postconstruction impact. Federal statutes and legislation, including the National Environmental Policy Act, Federal Energy Act of 2005, the Endangered Species Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty will require that prospective developers conduct some form of avian risk assessment prior to construction. Such preconstruction studies should utilize a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design. Offshore wind farms pose three primary threats to birds: barrier effects due to flight avoidance, habitat loss (due to displacement), and fatalities resulting from collisions with turbine blades. All have been demonstrated at land-based and coastal wind farms, and flight avoidance and shifts in habitat use have been demonstrated in the offshore environment for a limited number of species in Europe. The additive effect of these impacts to bird populations may be trivial under current levels of development, but could become ecologically significant as offshore installations increase as projected. Interpreting the ecological significance of these effects requires additional research, especially on understanding the importance of winter foraging habitat and population delineation, particularly for waterfowl.

At each iteration of the optimization, candidate plant parameters are generated by using G-optimal DoE. Unlike gradient-based approaches, the use of optimal DoE enables efficient global exploration of a plant design space that can contain multiple local optima. For each candidate plant design, the corresponding controller optimization is performed in real time, using extremum seeking. This enables the real-time adjustment of controller parameters during the course of simulations or experiments, thereby expediting the overall optimization process. The co-design process is carried out iteratively, where sub-optimal plant designs are rejected based on a response surface characterization and hypothesis testing. The co-design framework was validated in simulation for a Buoyant Airborne Turbine (BAT). Here, the optimized plant parameters were a reference area scale factor (scales the horizontal and vertical stabilizer areas uniformly) and center of mass location, whereas the optimized control parameter was the pitch angle setpoint. After four complete iterations, the flight performance index improved and the feasible plant design space (i.e., the locus of plant design parameters that could possibly be optimal, based on hypothesis testing) shrunk by 99%.

We used static detectors to record bat echolocation calls from boundaries (i.e. hedgerows) and central locations (open areas) at fields with solar PV development, and simultaneously at matched sites without solar PV developments (control fields). We used generalised linear mixed-effect models to assess how solar PV developments and boundary habitat affected bat activity and species richness.The activity of six of eight species/species groups analysed was negatively affected by solar PV panels, suggesting that loss and/or fragmentation of foraging/commuting habitat is caused by ground-mounted solar PV panels. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Nyctalus spp. activity was lower at solar PV sites regardless of the habitat type considered. Negative impacts of solar PV panels at field boundaries were apparent for the activity of Myotis spp. and Eptesicus serotinus, and in open fields for Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Plecotus spp.Bat species richness was greater along field boundaries compared with open fields, but there was no effect of solar PV panels on species richness.Policy implications: Ground-mounted solar photovoltaic developments have a significant negative effect on bat activity, and should be considered in appropriate planning legislation and policy.

In Wisconsin, EPFU is a threatened species with declining populations due to hibernacula disturbances, wind turbines, and habitat destruction. Due to their ecological and economic value, it is important to be able to release EPFU that enter wildlife rehabilitation centers back to the wild. This study evaluated the medical records of 454 EPFU (275 male, 179 female) admitted to a wildlife rehabilitation center inWisconsin from 2015 to 2020. For each bat, the season at intake, examination findings, length of time in rehabilitation, and final outcome (released or not released) were recorded. Using a multiple variable logistic regression model, there was a statistically significant positive association between length of time in the rehabilitation center and likelihood of release (odds ratio [OR] 1.08; 95% CI 1.06-1.12); this association can be explained by the need to overwinter some otherwise healthy bats in rehabilitation during hibernation. The following examination findings were associated with a significantly lower likelihood of release: wing injury (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.10-0.89) and decreased body condition (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.12-0.64). When corrected for time spent in rehabilitation (potentially artificially lengthened due to hibernation), patients admitted in the summer and fall were less likely to be released than those admitted in the winter (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.90-0.96 and OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.92-0.97, respectively).

To examine this complementarity and to investigate improving dialogue across these two sectors, we conducted paired ROI assessments from the perspective of wind development and biodiversity conservation in the northeastern United States. Spatially explicit layers defined the three ROI components: benefit, cost, and probability of success. For the wind development ROI, we modeled turbine suitability using the random forest algorithm to develop the benefit surface. We treated biodiversity information related to permitting and development as a cost surface and applied land conservation status towards the probability of success term. The conservation ROI applied biodiversity priorities as the benefit surface, applied a higher environmental cost to areas with high wind turbine development value, and used estimates of ecosystem resilience to define the probability of success. This ROI highlighted conservation potential after applying the constraints of wind energy development. The analysis suggests that New York State, US, may be able to accommodate 16,000 Megawatts of power generation while avoiding conservation priorities, more than sufficient landscape to situate turbines up to the predicted capacity based on grid reliability (6600 MW). Further, the two ROI models taken together are more instructive than results from either model alone. Sensitivity analyses revealed that altering the weightings of the biodiversity input variables rarely changed the relationship among the two ROI models from place to place. We suggest that applying ROI from different perspectives may help form an important communication bridge between conservation and development tradeoffs, and prove valuable in the debate over renewable energy production options in the context of their environmental impacts.

This article highlights that nuclear power and fossil-fuelled power systems have a host of environmental and wildlife costs as well, particularly for birds. Therefore, as a low-emission, low-pollution energy source, the wider use of wind energy can save wildlife and birds as it displaces these more harmful sources of electricity. The paper provides two examples: one relates to a calculation of avian fatalities across wind electricity, fossil-fueled, and nuclear power systems in the entire United States. It estimates that wind farms are responsible for roughly 0.27 avian fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while nuclear power plants involve 0.6 fatalities per GWh and fossil-fueled power stations are responsible for about 9.4 fatalities per GWh. Within the uncertainties of the data used, the estimate means that wind farm-related avian fatalities equated to approximately 46,000 birds in the United States in 2009, but nuclear power plants killed about 460,000 and fossil-fueled power plants 24 million.

However, the practice shows limitations in this interface and a reasonable distance from theory. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) stands out as an instrument for planning and impact prevention, which should be based on evidence developed through the application of the best scientific techniques to provide sufficient information and in a timely manner for the decision. The mechanisms of approximation between scientific knowledge regarding the potential impacts caused by a specific project typology and the information addressed in the practice of EIA are relatively unknown aspects. These mechanisms should be investigated in order to stablish adequate strategies for this approach. The present work aimed to identify the distance between scientific knowledge about the impacts potentially caused by wind energy projects and what is effectively presented to the decision-making process in EIA reports. The study object of this research was the EIA practice in the sector of wind energy generation in Brazil. The potential impacts of wind power generation described in the international literature were consolidated in a checklist, which was applied to the content of 31 EIA reports elaborated for projects in the state of Ceara (2010-2017), Brazil. Based on the checklist application it was possible to identify that, in general, there is a significant distance between the practice of EIA and current scientific knowledge. These results suggest that decisions about the acceptability of potential impacts are not being made based on the best available information and therefore possibly do not ensure the evaluation of significant impacts. On the other hand, the identification of specific positive cases highlights a favorable perspective for the environmental agencies to act in order to promote the approximation between the state-of-the-art of knowledge and the decision-making process supported by the EIA.",no,,135,0,0,5,23,DESENVOLV MEIO AMBIE,Desenvolv.

To understand how bats use vertical space, we tracked one to five foraging flights of eight common noctules (Nyctalus noctula). Bats were tracked for their full foraging session (87.27 +/- 24 min) using high-resolution atmospheric pressure radio transmitters that allowed us to calculate height and wingbeat frequency. Bats used diverse flight strategies, but generally flew lower than 40 m, with scouting flights to 100 m and a maximum of 300 m. We found no influence of weather on height, and high-altitude ascents were not preceded by an increase in foraging effort. Wingbeat frequency was independent from climbing or descending flight, and bats skipped wingbeats or glided in 10% of all observations. Wingbeat frequency was positively related to capture mass, and wingbeat frequency was positively related to time of night, indicating an effect of load increase over a foraging bout. Overall, individuals used a wide range of airspace including altitudes that put them at increased risk from human-made structures.

The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is particularly susceptible to collision with wind turbines, but only 1 option for offsetting mortalities has been approved by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service despite many sources of anthropogenic-caused mortality. We update a previously developed vehicle-collision model with data collected during 3 winters from 2016 to 2019 and integrate a resource equivalency analysis so that relocation of road-killed game animals can be used as mitigation to offset incidental mortality. We parameterized golden eagle behaviors using motion-sensitive cameras placed at roadside carcasses. We quantified the effects of different carcass-relocation schemes based on vehicle and carcass characteristics observed for Wyoming, USA. Our model results indicate that while eagles saved per relocated carcass depends on relocation interval and vehicle traffic volume, carcass relocation is a viable mitigation strategy; up to 7 eagles could be saved each year in some counties. While some uncertainty remains about the precise credit received from each carcass relocated, delaying the inclusion of additional mitigation methods prevents opportunities for conservation action. An adaptive management program could be a way forward where management and monitoring are combined to further improve estimates of mitigation credit.",no,,24,0,0,3,3,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J. Wildl.

Wind farms cause mortality of flying animals through collision with moving rotor blades, and from electrocution on associated power lines. Avian mortality rates have been estimated from birds collected under turbines over varying time intervals. However, without adequate and frequent monitoring, dead birds may be removed by scavengers and thus cause an underestimation of fatalities. In this paper, we tested experimentally for possible errors arising in avian mortality caused by the removal of carcasses by scavengers. At two different wind farms and associated power lines in southern Spain, we placed pigeon and quail carcasses to determine their disappearance rate. All dead pigeons were radio-tagged to estimate distances taken by scavengers. We found significant differences in carcass disappearance rates of pigeons and quails, and between wind farms and power lines but not between habitats. All quails and 45% of pigeon carcasses had disappeared by the third and fourteenth day, respectively. Less than half (40%) of the carcasses were found < 100 m from where they were deposited. While scavenging losses may vary according to the location of the wind farm or power line, here we propose a method to estimate correctly the number of fatalities at any wind farm and power line. Using this method, we can improve our understanding of the real impact of wind structures on adjacent bird communities, and adopt appropriate measures to ensure their conservation.",no,,44,4,4,0,62,BIRD CONSERV INT,Bird Conserv.

Echolocation is an active sensing system used by hundreds of mammal species, primarily bats. As echolocation call activity can be reliably quantified, bats present an excellent model system to investigate intraspecific variation in environmental cue sampling. Here, we developed an in situ roost-like novel environment assay for tree-roosting bats. We repeatedly tested 52 individuals of the migratory bat species, Pipistrellus nathusii, across 24 h, to examine the role of echolocation when crawling through a maze-type arena and test for consistent intraspecific variation in sensory-based exploration. We reveal a strong correlation between echolocation call activity and spatial activity. Moreover, we show that during the exploration of the maze, individuals consistently differed in spatial activity as well as echolocation call activity, given their spatial activity, a behavioral response we term 'acoustic exploration'. Acoustic exploration was correlated with other exploratory behaviors, but not with emergence latency.

Raptors are a group at particular risk and often the focus of post-construction fatality monitoring programs. To estimate fatalities from detected carcasses requires correction for biases, including for carcasses that are removed or decompose before the following search. This is addressed through persistence trials, where carcasses are monitored until no longer detectable or the trial ends. Sourcing sufficient raptor carcasses for trials is challenging and surrogates that are typically used often have shorter persistence times than raptors. We collated information from raptor carcass persistence trials to evaluate consistencies between trials and assess the implications of using persistence values from other studies in wind facility fatality estimates. We compiled individual raptor carcass persistence times from published sources along with information on methods and location, estimated carcass persistence using GenEst and ran full fatality estimates using the carcass persistence estimates and mock datasets for other information. We compiled results from 22 trials from 17 sites across four terrestrial biomes, with trials lasting between 7 and 365 days and involving between 11 and 115 carcasses. Median carcass persistence was estimated at 420 days (90% confidence interval (CI) of 290 to 607 days) for the full dataset. Persistence time varied significantly between trials (trial-specific persistence estimates of 14 (5-42) days to 1,586 (816-3,084) days) but not between terrestrial biomes. We also found no significant relationship between either the number of carcasses in the trial or trial duration and estimated carcass persistence. Using a mock dataset with 12 observed fatalities, we estimated annual fatalities of 25 (16-33) or 26 (17-36) individuals using a 14- or 28-day search interval respectively using global dataset. When using trial-specific carcass persistence estimates and the same mock dataset, estimated annual fatalities ranged from 22 (14-30) to 37 (21-63) individuals for a 14-day search interval, and from 22 (15-31) to 47 (26-84) individuals for a 28-day search interval. The different raptor carcass persistence rates between trials translated to small effects on fatality estimates when using recommended search frequencies, since persistence rates were generally much longer than the search interval. When threatened raptor species, or raptors of particular concern to stakeholders are present, and no site-specific carcass persistence estimates are available, projects should use the lowest median carcass persistence estimate from this study to provide precautionary estimates of fatalities. At sites without threatened species, or where the risk of collision to raptors is low, the global median carcass persistence estimate from this review could be used to provide a plausible estimate for annual raptor fatalities.",no,,42,1,1,1,2,PEERJ,PeerJ,15-Nov,2022,10,,10.7717/peerj.14163,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14163,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

First, we try to shift the perspective from humans towards wildlife and regard modern era (near) extinctions of selected wildlife species as an ultimate expression of HWC. We then reflect on the legitimacy of ecosystem comparisons beyond the borders of biogeographical regions-an important prerequisite for global approaches. In the following, we present two case scenarios that exemplarily illustrate the topic from different perspectives: carnivore-livestock conflicts (classical view, human perspective) and wind turbine-induced mortality of bats (wildlife perspective, rarely regarded as a form of HWC). On this basis, we try to develop a framework that enables a global approach, while adequately considering case- and region-specificity. We think that a globally valid and generally approachable dimension can be defined, as long as there is a natural link: in the present case the established monophyly of the orders Carnivora and Chiroptera, i.e., representatives descending from common ancestors, thus sharing common ecological features.

However, the extent to which they may support bat populations is contentious. Many studies have demonstrated active avoidance of coniferous plantations and attributed this to the lack of available roost sites and low invertebrate density. In contrast, other work, carried out in plantation dominated landscapes have shown that certain bat species are able to exploit these areas. However, the extent to which bats use plantations for roosting and foraging, or simply move through the plantation matrix to access more favourable sites is unclear. We radio tracked female Pipistrellus pygmaeus over two summers to establish the extent to which individual bats use Sitka Spruce plantations in southern Scotland for foraging and roosting and assess the implications for felling operations on bats. Maternity roosts identified (n = 17) were in all in buildings and most were large (> 500 individuals). We found no evidence of bats roosting in mature Sitka Spruce crop trees, although several bats used roosts in old or dead beech and oak trees as an alternative to their main maternity roost. Home ranges were much larger (mean 9.6 +/- 3.12 km(2)) than those reported from other studies (0.6-1.6 km(2)), and it is likely that roost availability rather than food abundance constrains P. pygmaeus use of Sitka Spruce plantations. At the landscape scale, most individuals selected coniferous habitats over other habitat types, covering large distances to access plantation areas, whilst at a local scale bats used forest tracks to access water, felled stands or patches of broadleaf cover within the plantation. Sitka Spruce plantations support a high abundance of Culicoides impuctatus, the Highland midge which may act as a reliable and plentiful food source for females during lactation, an energetically expensive period. The use of felled stands for foraging by bats has implications for forest management as wind turbines, following small-scale felling operations, are increasingly being installed in plantations; wind turbines have been associated with high bat mortality in some countries. Decisions about siting wind turbines in upland plantations should consider the likelihood of increased bat activity post felling.",no,,73,4,4,0,16,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,4-Oct,2018,13,10,10.1371/journal.pone.0204511,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204511,,,21,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics

Furthermore, extending grid availability to farflung regions with higher distribution losses is not economically viable. Therefore, a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) is developed, and its socio-techno-economic-environmental (STEE) viability in supplying reliable electricity to the village is being examined in this paper. STEE factor-based multi-target optimization and sizing technique are designed using the HOMER PRO software. The factors considered are namely social (land cost, human progress index, and employment generation factor), technical (unmet load, renewable energy portion, duty factor, and excess energy factor), economical (annualized cost of system, cost of energy, and total net present cost), and environmental (carbon emission and particulate matter). Three HRES setups are investigated, with various combinations of photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), battery (BAT), biogas generator (BG), and diesel generator (DG) and the optimal configuration is selected by STEE performance analysis. Compared to other evaluated setups, the HRES design with PV-WT-BAT-BG-DG is optimal for a consistent power supply. A sensitivity analysis for the optimal setup's macroeconomic variables and component costs is performed to achieve a more feasible optimal setup.

J,"Huso, MMP",An estimator of wildlife fatality from observed carcasses,ENVIRONMETRICS,English,Article,bias; carcass persistence; detectability; searcher efficiency; search interval; wind turbines,BIRD MORTALITY; BUFFALO RIDGE; POPULATION; MINNESOTA; BATS,"Counts of animal carcasses are often used to estimate fatality caused by disease, environmental accidents (oil spills, radiation leaks), or human structures (power lines, sky scrapers, wind turbines). The need to adjust raw carcass counts for imperfect detectability to produce unbiased estimates of fatality has long been recognized, but the accuracy and precision of some estimators used to make the adjustments have not been evaluated. In this paper, I formalize a conceptual model of fatality and the factors that lead to imperfect detection, primarily removal by scavengers before searches can be carried out and inability of searchers to find all remaining carcasses. I propose an estimator of fatality that adjusts for imperfect detectability. Through simulation I evaluate the statistical properties (bias and precision) of this estimator and two others commonly used to estimate fatality at wind power facilities, when sources and magnitudes of imperfect detectability vary. None of the estimators was always unbiased under all conditions. Bias in the proposed estimator never exceeded +/- 27% whereas bias in the other two estimators was always negative and exceeded that of the proposed estimator in 98% and 93% of the simulated conditions, respectively. The proposed estimator was relatively robust to variation in sources and magnitudes of imperfect detectability, but was sensitive to distributional assumptions regarding carcass removal rates and searcher efficiency. It offers significant improvement over two current estimators and provides relatively unbiased estimates of fatality that can be applied under a variety of conditions and survey protocols.

Power management in MG is challengeable utilizing energy storage and generation components like PV, diesel generator, micro-hydro generator, battery bank with a bidirectional inverter. In this paper, the power management of the MG is investigated with the proposed droop controller. The droop controller is intended to get the optimal energy management of MG. The proposed method is the combination of Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) with a Bat algorithm to enhance the power management of MG. The ALO calculation is a nature-inspired algorithm. It imitates the chasing system of ant lions in nature. The Bat algorithm is utilized to refresh the insect lion position of the ALO algorithm. The droop control is sharing the power in the generation side depends upon the load demand of the grid side through the control action of the real and reactive power. The goal of the paper is used to enhance the real and reactive power of MG. With the assistance of the proposed technique, the real and reactive power is enhanced and the voltage is controlled. Based on the droop characteristics, power management is accomplished continuously by way of the upgraded proposed approach. The proposed strategy is executed in the MATLAB/Simulink platform and also analysis of the PV power, wind power, power demand, real power, reactive power, voltage, current, demand values, and grid power. The upgrading proposed framework is compared to current techniques such as CSO and PSO algorithms.

In addition to the extensive development of wind power on land, currently several European countries have offshore wind farms (OWFs) in operation, as well as proposals to build many more. Considering that seabirds spend more than 90% of their life at sea, it is clear that they may interact with these man-made structures. To date, information on how to measure the impact of OWFs on seabirds is very scarce. In many cases it comes from non-peer reviewed reports made for specific assessment studies, very often carried out without appropriate standard methodologies, that raise questions regarding the level of confidence that they merit. In this paper, we describe the current political framework concerning the possible development of OWFs in Spain. Based on this, we comment on both the relevant variables necessary to assess the impacts of OWFs on birds and the methodologies available to collect those variables in the field, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each method. We show the importance of collision risk models, vulnerability indexes, cumulative impact assessment and population viability analysis as management tools. Mitigation measures that have the potential to minimise impacts are also summarised.

This optimization strategy is tailored towards instances where a closed-form expression for the system dynamics is unobtainable and simulations or experiments are necessary. Specifically, Bayesian Optimization, which is a data-driven technique for finding the optimum of an unknown and expensive-to-evaluate objective function, is employed to solve the nested optimization problem. The underlying objective function is modeled by a Gaussian Process (GP); then, Bayesian Optimization utilizes the predictive uncertainty information from the GP to decide the best subsequent control or plant parameters. The proposed framework differs from the majority of co-design literature where there exists a closed-form model of the system dynamics. We validate the proposed framework for Altaeros' Buoyant Airborne Turbine (BAT). We choose the horizontal stabilizer area and longitudinal center of mass relative to center of buoyancy (plant parameters) and the pitch angle set point (controller parameter) as our decision variables.

However, the implementation of offset measures is currently very unsatisfactory from a biodiversity perspective, and many development projects do not incorporate them. Here, we proposed a method for comparing biodiversity level between different land-uses to propose a set of alternative offset measures offering the same biodiversity outcomes. Biodiversity level (including both bird and bat communities) was calculated from the variation in biodiversity from each land-uses (fallow, grass strip, bush, grass strip with bushes, hedgerow) compared to crops (control). In order to account for local specificities of environmental assessment studies, we modulated the calculation of the biodiversity level following three examples of scenarios that differed according to the weights assigned to different species. For each scenario, hedgerow was always the land-use that generated the greatest biodiversity level, and was found to be the best alternative in terms of effect size. The advantage of this method and its weighting system is that the opinions of local stakeholders and specificities of species, such as their sensibility level to the development project or their conservation status, can be taken into account, resulting in the results being better appropriated. Thus, offset measures could be implemented more efficiently thanks to multi-taxonomic calculations and weighing possibilities, improving biodiversity outcomes. This method can also be used to compare the residual loss of biodiversity and biodiversity gains from implemented offset measures, using the same biodiversity metric.",no,,67,1,1,7,44,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,FEB,2021,101,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105161,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105161,,21-Jan,11,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology

Land-based wind farms are amongst the commonest generators of renewable energy. To date, most research on the effects of wind farms on wildlife have focussed on birds and bats, with very little work on terrestrial taxa. We hypothesised that widely reported negative effects of wind farms on predatory birds might benefit potential prey species. We focussed on reptiles due to concerns over worldwide declines in this group. We compared avian attack rates on clay model snakes at a site in Caithness UK within a wind farm relative to a control site of the same topography and habitat class, 1 km away, using life-sized clay models of adderVipera berus, a widespread but declining Palaearctic species. Attack rates at the control site were comparable with similar studies elsewhere in Europe. However, we found that attack rates were lower within wind farm arrays, although several species of bird known to prey on reptiles were observed both within the wind farm and the control site. Therefore, given the high rate of loss to avian predators experienced in reptile reintroduction and reinforcement projects, wind farm sites may offer safe-havens, representing a neglected opportunity in reptile conservation. Grazing by sheep severely offset this benefit, presumably through removal of plant cover which was apparent in those areas of the wind farm where sheep were allowed access; grazing must thus be managed carefully for these benefits to be realised.",no,,83,2,2,1,11,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

Fortunately, risks to wildlife from wind energy may be alleviated through proper siting and mitigation offsets. Here we identify areas in Kansas where wind development is incompatible with conservation, areas where wind development may proceed but with compensatory mitigation for impacts, and areas where development could proceed without the need for compensatory mitigation. We demonstrate that approximately 10.3 million ha in Kansas (48 percent of the state) has the potential to provide 478 GW of installed capacity while still meeting conservation goals. Of this total, approximately 2.7 million ha would require no compensatory mitigation and could produce up to 125 GW of installed capacity. This is 1,648 percent higher than the level of wind development needed in Kansas by 2030 if the United States is to get 20 percent of its electricity from wind.

The platform overcomes the financial burden of full-scale testing, which simultaneously alleviates the short-term need for high-fidelity dynamic models and aids in the long-term development of high-fidelity models.

Decision variables include the installation site of the hybrid system and size of the wind farm and battery storage. These variables are found with the help of a novel metaheuristic approach called improved Fick's law algorithm (IFLA). To enhance the exploration performance and avoid the early incomplete convergence of the conventional Fick's law (FLA) algorithm, a dynamic lens-imaging learning strategy (DLILS) based on opposition learning has been adopted. The planning problem has been implemented in two approaches without and considering BDC to analyze its impact on the reserve power level and the amount and quality of power loss, voltage profile, and reliability. A 33-bus distribution system has also been employed to validate the capability and efficiency of the suggested method. Simulation results have shown that the multi-objective planning of the hybrid WT/Battery energy system improves voltage and reliability and decreases power loss by managing the reserve power based on charging and discharging battery units and creating electrical planning with optimal power injection into the network. The results of simulations and evaluation of statistic analysis indicate the superiority of the IFLA in achieving the optimal solution with faster convergence than conventional FLA, particle swarm optimization (PSO), manta ray foraging optimizer (MRFO), and bat algorithm (BA). It has been observed that the proposed methodology based on IFLA in different approaches has obtained lower power loss and more desirable voltage profile and reliability than its counterparts. Simulation reports demonstrate that by considering BDC, the values of losses and voltage deviations are increased by 2.82% and 1.34%, respectively, and the reliability of network customers is weakened by 5.59% in comparison with a case in which this cost is neglected.

The number of detected carcasses, or the absence of carcasses, however needs to be corrected for imperfect detection and early removal by scavengers. To perform this correction, there exist more than a dozen open variants of the Lincoln-Petersen closed-population capture-recapture estimator. These different variants typically yield very different results because they are based on different assumptions that end users do not always consider. I conduct a simulation study highlighting severe biases in Lincoln-Petersen type estimators when their assumptions are violated. Recent attempts to relax these assumptions within the closed population capture-recapture paradigm involve increasingly complex analysis, yet the resulting modified estimators still apply to restricted settings only. By contrast, there is an abundant literature about flexible, process based, open-population capture-recapture models and how to fit them to survey data using numerical likelihood optimization. My simulations illustrate the good performance of this approach, in the presence of complex sources of bias, for moderate sample sizes. I review existing guidelines to deal with sparser datasets. As a perspective, I use the example of bird mortality estimation in wind farms to argue that the lack of methodological consensus can set the stage for evidence complacency.

The goal is to find the optimum (OP) combination of an HRES in seven locations (Loc) in Saudi Arabia. The proposed load demand is 988.97 kWh/day, and the peak load is 212.34 kW. The results of the cost of energies (COEs) range between 0.108 to 0.143 USD/kWh. Secondly, the optimum size of the PV panels with different trackers is calculated. The HRES uses 100 kW PV in combination with other components. Additionally, the size of the PVs where 100% PV panels are used to reach the load demand in the selected locations is found. Finally, two sensitivity analyses (Sens) on the proposed PV and tracker costs and solar GHIs are conducted. The main goal of the article is to find the most cost-effective tracker system under different conditions while considering environmental aspects such as the CO2 social penalty. The results show an increase of 35% in power production from PV (compared to not using a tracker) when using a two-axis tracker system. However, it is not always cost-effective.

Such a structure requires a powerful and distributed optimal scheduling framework to avoid central control mechanism used in the conventional microgrids. In order to get into this concept, this article investigates the optimal operation and management of hybrid AC-DC microgrids in a distributed multi-agent framework. The proposed framework first splits the hybrid microgrid into several agents and then uses a distributed formulation to solve the optimal scheduling problem. Different agents can exchange limited information with each other until the consensus happens through several iterations. Using the alternating direction method of multipliers, it is proved that the final consensus operating point is the global optimal solution for the hybrid microgrid cost operation. Due to the high-nonlinearity and -nonconvex characteristics of the augmented Lagrangian formed in the proposed framework, a new optimization algorithm based on modified bat algorithm (MBA) is also proposed to solve the proposed augmented function. The proposed MBA is strengthened by a new modification method to escape from the many local optima and avoid premature convergence. In order to model the uncertainty effects, point estimate method of 2m-scheme is employed to model the forecast error in wind turbine and photovoltaics output power, load demand and the market price. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method are examined on an IEEE test.",no,,22,5,5,0,4,IJST-T ELECTR ENG,Iran. J. Sci. Technol.-Trans. Electr.

There is a need for new data sources that can be used to create risk assessments across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and weather radar data have shown promise in this regard. A primary limitation on the use of weather radar data in macroscale ecology has been the difficulty in data access and processing to make real-time assessments, and the lack of species-level information. We compared two weather radar products, Level II and UNQC-CREF that differ in several aspects. We found the 2D UNQC-CREF product provides similar information to Level II data regarding spatial and temporal patterns of bioscatter, although not without caveats. Due to its rapid availability and ease of use, we combined UNQC-CREF data with eBird daily species counts to quantify autumnal migration along one of North America's major migratory routes. During their autumn migration southward, we predicted birds would use prevailing winds and favorable atmospheric conditions to time their migratory movements. Wind direction and ordinal date were strong predictors as were variables associated with inclement weather, including barometric pressure and ambient temperature. These patterns suggest that at a coarse scale, migratory birds avoid headwinds during their southerly movements during autumn, and more broadly indicate that local weather conditions can be used to predict pulses of migratory activity in the aerosphere. Our results suggest that similar methods could be used to measure the temporal and spatial components of avian migration at greater spatial scales - providing crucial information for conservation and management for migratory faunas. Specifically, future algorithms should focus on real-time implementation for bird strike mitigation, by altering wind energy facility operation on nights of peak migratory flow, in addition to timing lights-out events to minimize collisions with existing infrastructure such as buildings.",no,,62,12,13,2,31,REMOTE SENS ECOL CON,Remote Sens.

Thousands of small animals (such as many passerine birds with high mortality rates) die every day, but dead animals are rarely found by casual observers in the field. What is the fate of small carcasses in European ecosystems? During this project, we placed 120 defrosted day-old chicks (Gallus gallus f. domestica) as a model for a small carcass in a variety of habitats in southwestern Germany between the end of May and the beginning of December 2014. Using automatic trail cameras, we recorded the scavengers which visited the carrion or were feeding on it. Overall, two-thirds of the carcasses were removed under these conditions within a 5-day period. During the summer months, 20 % of the chicks were buried by burying beetles (Nicrophorus sp.), and 40 % were removed by nine mammal and three bird species. The most important vertebrate scavengers were the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), the Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo), the European Magpie (Pica pica) and the Domestic Cat (Felis catus). Among the scavenged chicks, 38.8 % vanished during the first 24 h of exposure. The median persistence time was 2.79 days.

The use of fossil energy such as coal and diesel will contribute to a very large level of emissions that can lead to an increase in global warming. But on the other hand, investment for the construction of new and renewable energy generators is still relatively expensive. To reduce losses on investment costs, it is necessary to study the locations where new and renewable energy plants will be built. Sebesi Island is one of the most remote islands in Indonesia and has beautiful beaches and extraordinary natural resources. However, currently, the supply of electrical energy is still using diesel generators. Higher fuel prices and shipping costs, increasingly scarce fossil energy sources and the resulting environmental effects are the factors behind this study. Options for non-fossil energy use need to be considered. This study examines the economic and environmental feasibility.

Distributed microgrids that incorporate renewable energy sources with conventional fossil fuels have especially gained strong mo-mentum for providing power to rural areas. The present paper discusses the optimization of a hybrid system composed of CHP-based diesel generators (DG), a natural gas boiler, photovoltaics (PV), wind turbines (WT), and a battery bank (BAT) under tropical weather conditions. The HOMER optimization algorithm and sensitivity analysis tool are used to analyze the effect of project variables such as component prices, renewable resources potential, power grid breakeven distance, and power consumption profile on performance. The optimum sce-nario using only economic factors and assuming cycle charging is a PV/WT/DG/BAT/Boiler system with 6 kW of WT, 7.55 kW of PV, 10 kW of DG, and 21 kWh of battery that can achieve a 0.143 $/kWh cost of energy with a renewable fraction of 37.1%. Implementation of TOPSIS method considering sustainable development goals for criteria weighting eliminates the DG, and leads to a 100% renewable configuration of PV/WT/BAT/Boiler with 18 kW of WT, 33.2 kW of PV, 119 kWh of battery, and 0.301 $/kWh cost of energy. The main contribution of this study can be seen in providing a new approach for weighting the TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making process based on UN sustainable development goals.

For the first time, the two methodologies of Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) Pro software and exergetic evaluation are integrated. In this novel decision-making approach, a commercial and user-friendly optimizer software is hybridized with exergy calculations. In this study, techno-economic analysis for the rural electrification purpose is investigated. Accordingly, several combined energy systems consist of Photovoltaic panels (PV), Wind Turbines (WT), Battery banks (Bat), and Diesel Generator (DG) are techno-economically investigated. Also, to improve technical evaluation of suggested hybrid renewable systems, the detailed exergy analysis is conducted for each component and the whole system. By applying exergy assessment, the main source of exergy wasting is recognized and the feasible solutions can be introduced to improve the technical performance. The outcomes illustrated that the cost of energy and net present cost of best scenario are 0.17 $/kWh and 168,378 $, respectively. The overall exergy efficiency and exergy destruction rate of optimum configuration (PV/WT/DG/Bat) are accounted for 25.96% and 303206.86 kWh/year, respectively. Also, it was found that 88.68% of the overall exergy wasting occurred in the PV modules. The mean annual exergy efficiency of PV modules and wind plant are computed as 13.03% and 72.25%, respectively. Correspondingly, to diminish the exergy wasting of the system, utilization of different common solar trackers is examined. To investigate the cost-effectiveness of each proposed tracking system, the Cost-Effective Index (CEI) is defined. The more the CEI, the more the cost-effectiveness of energy configuration. The vertical tracking system with a capacity of 20.1 kW PV has the greatest value of CEI (13.49), as a result, this system is the most cost-effective option. By employing this configuration, the overall exergy efficiency increases to 32.14%, and the overall irreversibility rate reduces to 224054.14 kWh/year. Finally, the parametric analyses regarding the economic factors, exergy parameters, and renewable resources are conducted to generalize the outcomes of this project to other rural areas. This proposed decision-making process can be a powerful tool with high reliability for techno-economic evaluation of each hybrid renewable configuration.",no,,51,29,29,0,9,SUSTAIN ENERGY TECHN,Sustain.

In this paper authors propose a distributed power generation system with interconnected loads (microgrid), made up by solar panels (PV), wind turbines (WT), a batteries bank (BAT) and a modular fuel cell system. In addition, an electrolyzer (load) will convert the electrical energy into chemical energy with the use of hydrogen like energy vector. To put in work this micro grid, it is needed a proper energy management strategy which takes into account both technical and economical parameters (smart grid).

The appearance of PEVs in the electric grid can create new challenges for the operation of distributed generations and power units inside the network. In order to deal with this issue, a new stochastic optimization method is devised to let the central controll manage the power units and charging behavior of PEVs. The problem formulation aims to minimize the total cost of the network including the cost of power supply for loads and PEVs as well as the cost of energy not supplied (ENS) as the reliability costs. In order to make PEVs as opportunity for the grid, the vehicle-2-grid (V2G) technology is employed to reduce the operational costs. To model the high uncertain behavior of wind turbine, photovoltaics and the charging and discharging pattern of PEVs, a new stochastic power flow based on unscented transform is proposed.

The study is implemented for a stand-alone hybrid system based on wind turbines (WG), batteries (BAT) and hydrogen technology. The P-PMS uses real-time Neural Network (NN) predictions of wind speed and load demand to adjust the control set points affecting the switching of devices. The study also analyses the effects of using another intelligent technique, Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), for real-time optimisation of fuel cell operation. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used to optimally size the hydrogen system. The methods employed include MATLAB simulations to implement the three intelligent techniques (GA, NN and PSO) and integration of experimentally derived fuel cell characteristics as well as highly dynamic electric load and wind speed profiles. The research presented in this study is an extension of an earlier work in which the concept of P-PMS was experimentally validated and the effects of some software and hardware related controlling parameters assessed. This paper however goes further by analysing the impact of using P-PMS on the economic and operational characteristics of stand-alone hydrogen systems by benchmarking it against an R-PMS. Results reveal that a hybrid system operating under a P-PMS outperforms that with an R-PMS in terms of cost, renewables penetration and environmental footprint. In addition, this study showed that P-PMS can help mitigate the impact of the transient response of the backup components (fuel cell and electrolyser) on the system sizing and operation. However, these merits are realised only if a particularly high reliability of load satisfaction is required. Results also show that a P-PMS highly depends on the accuracy of the employed (NN) prediction tool. The proposed predictive strategies are proven to be better than other solutions that exist in literature in terms of reducing the cost. Copyright (C) 2016, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

As a result, the electricity supply of large-scale tourism sectors is an important challenge in many countries. In current study, the feasibility study for applying the hybrid renewable energy systems to provide the power demand in social areas is investigated. Since Iran has a lot of tourism areas with a high amount of electricity consumption, a popular and crowded tourism sector in the Qom (a city in the center of Iran) is selected as the case study. The electricity consumption of this social area is found to be 23,808.91 kWh/day, which in the current system is supplied by the electricity grid. Also, the values of cost of energy and carbon dioxide emissions of current system are calculated to be 0.0931$/kWh and 5,741,214 kg/year, respectively. Regarding the available renewable resources of Qom city and the space limitations of this tourism sector, several combined renewable scenarios are simulated and assessed applying the HOMER Pro simulator. In continue, to identify the optimal scenarios, the techno-economic-environmental evaluation is implemented. The hybrid photovoltaic (PV)/wind turbine (WT)/battery (Bat)/diesel generator (DG)/biogas generator (BG), and grid/PV/WT are found as the optimum configurations for the off-grid and grid-connected systems, respectively. It was found that the Grid/PV/WT has a net present cost of 6.63 M$ and a cost of energy of 0.0234 $/kWh. Also, the cost of energy and net present cost of hybrid PV/WT/Bat/DG/BG are accounted for 0.1251$/kWh and 18.1 M$, respectively.

In following, to assess the effects of load growth and PV degradation on system performance, the multi-year module of this software is employed. Based on the obtained findings, by applying the hybrid PV/WT/Bat/DG/BG instead of the current system, the contribution of emissions penalties to the overall net present cost diminishes from 15.47% to 0.73%.

Some of loads participate in a demand control program. The OMS is mathematically formulated as a multi-period mixed-integer stochastic nonlinear optimization. It has to decide the hourly power share of each DDG, the states of the control switches, and specifications of demand response. The OMS aims to minimize the total operation cost, unmet load, and curtailed renewable power maintaining all technical constraints. The uncertainty of renewable resources and load is analyzed in the OMS by Monte-Carlo simulation while scenario-reduction approach is used to reduce the computational burden.

Increasing the visibility of these structures may reduce collisions but may only be accepted by local residents if it does not create a visual disturbance. Recent research has shown the potential for ultraviolet (UV) light, which is nearly imperceptible to humans, to mitigate avian collisions with anthropogenic structures. We tested the effectiveness of two UV (390-400 nm) Avian Collision Avoidance Systems (ACASs) at reducing collisions at two 260-m spans of marked power lines at the Iain Nicolson Audubon Center at Rowe Sanctuary, an important migratory bird stopover location in Nebraska. We used a randomized design and a tiered model selection approach employing generalized linear models and the Akaike Information Criterion to assess the effectiveness of ACASs considering environmental (e.g., precipitation) and detection probability (e.g., migration chronology) variables. We found focal (assessed power line) and distal (neighboring power line) ACAS status and environmental variables were important predictors of avian collisions. Our top model suggests that the focal ACAS illumination reduced collisions by 88%, collisions were more likely at moderate (10-16 km/h) compared to lower or higher wind speeds, and collision frequency decreased with precipitation occurrence. Our top model also indicates that the distal ACAS illumination reduced collisions by 39.4% at the focal power line when that ACAS was off, suggesting a positive neighbor effect  of power line illumination. Although future applications of ACASs would benefit from additional study to check for potential negative effects (for example, collisions involving nocturnal foragers such as bats or caprimulgiform birds drawn to insects), we suggest that illuminating power lines, guy wires, towers, wind turbines, and other anthropogenic structures with UV illumination will likely lower collision risks for birds while increasing human acceptance of mitigation measures in urban areas.",no,,109,1,1,4,13,AVIAN CONSERV ECOL,Avian Conserv.

The materials most frequently used in composite manufacturing, such as matrix (polyester, viny lester, phenolic, epoxies, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, benzoil peroxide, hardeners, and solvents), and reinforcement materials (carbon, glass and Kevlar fibers, honeycomb and foams) can be highly toxic to human body.

So far, a number of studies have been conducted amongst which a single scenario based design is the mostly studied. However, we argue that handling multiple scenarios in the context of HRES design is more practical since operating conditions of a HRES (e.g., load demand) can be different periodically. For example, when designing HRES for a farmland, the busy season time and slack season time are two representative scenarios that correspond to substantially different load demand. Surprisingly, there is no adequate study of multi-scenario oriented multi-objective optimal HRES design. This study therefore fills in this research gap. A multi-scenario optimization based method is proposed for HRES design. Specifically, taking the PV(photovoltaic)-WT (wind turbines)-Bat(Battery)-DG (Diesel generator) as an example, a two-scenario bi-objective optimization model (minimization of system cost while maximization of system reliability) is proposed. In order to solve the model effectively, a scenariodominance based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (denoted as s-NSGA-II) is proposed. Lastly, a case study is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, that is, s-NSGA-II is able to find well-balanced solutions for all scenarios, which therefore leads the s-NSGA-II to be a good alternative for dealing with the optimal design of HRES under multiple scenarios.

The proposed control strategy is the parallel execution of both the ant lion optimization with artificial neural network (ANN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), and hence it is named as ALANN/RNN. Here, the HRES is made out of photovoltaic, wind turbine, fuel cell, and battery which is associated with the DC link and can adjust the real and reactive power. The proposed ALANN/RNN technique predicts the required control gain parameters of the HRES to maintain the power flow based on the active and reactive power variation in the load side. To predict the control gain parameters, the proposed technique considers power balance constraints like renewable energy accessibility and load side power demand. By using the proposed technique, power flow variations between the source side and the load side and the operational cost of HRES in light of weekly and daily prediction grid electricity prices have been minimized. In the HRES unit, the power flow management of grid is accomplished while controlling the PI controller for producing the optimal control pulses of the DC/DC converter. The proposed method is actualized in MATLAB/Simulink working stage, and the effectiveness is analyzed via the comparison analysis using the existing techniques such as SPC, GA, PSO and BAT technique. The comparison results demonstrate that the occurrence of proposed approach confirms its ability for controlling the power flow in the HRES system.",no,,41,11,11,1,15,SOFT COMPUT,Soft Comput.,DEC,2019,23,24,10.1007/s00500-019-03885-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-019-03885-9,,,17,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science

The photovoltaic, wind turbine, fuel cell and battery are also presented. The proposed technique is the combined execution of both spotted hyena optimization and elephant herding optimization. Spotted hyena optimization is utilized to optimize the combination of controller parameters based on the voltage variation. In the proposed technique, the spotted hyena optimization combined with elephant herding optimization plays out the assessment procedure to establish the exact control signals for the system and builds up the control signals for offline way in light of the power variety between source side and load side. The objective function is defined by the system data subject to equality and inequality constraints such as real and reactive power limits, power loss limit, and power balance of the system and so on. The constraint is the availability of the renewable energy sources and power demand from the load side in which the battery is used only for lighting load. By utilizing the proposed method, the power flow constraints are restored into secure limits with the reduced cost. At that point, the proposed model is executed in the Matrix Laboratory/Simulink working platform and the execution is assessed with the existing techniques. In this article, the performance analysis of proposed and existing techniques such as elephant herding optimization, particle swarm optimization, and bat algorithm are evaluated. Furthermore, the statistical analysis is also performed.

The current targets by 2027 are 55% of total electricity generating capacity by mostly wind and to a more limited extent solar photovoltaic, an even larger than 55% reduction of the electricity generating capacity by combustion fuels, and a 33% reduction in electricity con-sumption. No mention is made of the battery energy storage to make the grid stable, more efficient, and cleaner use of combustion fuels, the pollution from transport, and the management of waste and biomass. The resource is modest for wind, and better for solar photovoltaic. The area is prone to hurricanes that may damage the wind energy installations. Additionally, wind requires the interconnection of the 16 island grids. It is demonstrated here that better CO2 reduction can be achieved by building electricity generating capacity of solar photovoltaic only, leaving the capacity of hydrocarbon fuel facilities upgraded for cleaner production, switching to electric transport, and valorizing biomass and waste. This makes unnecessary wind energy developments, which will also impact adversely the landscape and the environment, being noxious to humans and wildlife, disturbing natural scenery, and touristic attraction.",no,,61,2,2,0,0,CURR RES ENVIRON SUS,Curr.

Simultaneously, the biodiversity crisis demands equally urgent action to prevent further species loss and promote restoration and rehabilitation of ecosystems. Climate action itself must prevent further pressures on biodiversity and options for synergistic gains for both climate and biodiversity change mitigation and adaptation need to be explored and implemented. Here, we review the key potential impacts of climate mitigation measures in energy and land-use on biodiversity, including the development of renewable energy such as offshore and onshore wind, solar, and bioenergy. We also assess the potential impacts of climate action driven afforestation and native habitat rehabilitation and restoration. We apply our findings to Ireland as a unique case-study as the government develops a coordinated response to climate and biodiversity change through declaration of a joint climate and biodiversity emergency and inclusion of biodiversity in key climate change legislation and the national Climate Action Plan. However, acknowledgement of these intertwined crises is only a first step; implementation of synergistic solutions requires careful planning. We demonstrate how synergy between climate and biodiversity action can be gained through explicit consideration of the effects of climate change mitigation strategies, such as energy infrastructure development and land-use change, on biodiversity. We identify several potential win-win strategies for both climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation. For Ireland, these include increasing offshore wind capacity, rehabilitating natural areas surrounding onshore wind turbines, and limiting the development of solar photovoltaics to the built environment. Ultimately, climate mitigation should be implemented in a Right Action, Right Place framework to maximise positive biodiversity benefits. This review provides one of the first examples of how national climate actions can be implemented in a biodiversity-conscious way to initiate discussion about synergistic solutions for both climate and biodiversity.",no,,177,1,1,18,29,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

To overcome this potential difficulty and obtain more accurate measures of the flight altitudes and numbers of individual migrants, we have developed a technique that combines a vertically pointed stationary radar beam and a vertically pointed thermal imaging camera (VERTRAD/TI). The TI provides accurate counts of the birds passing through a fixed, circular sampling area in the TI display, and the radar provides accurate data on their flight altitudes. We analyzed samples of VERTRAD/TI video data collected during nocturnal fall migration in 2000 and 2003 and during the arrival of spring trans-Gulf migration during the daytime in 2003. We used a video peak store (VPS) to make time exposures of target tracks in the video record of the TI and developed criteria to distinguish birds, foraging bats, and insects based on characteristics of the tracks in the VPS images and the altitude of the targets. The TI worked equally well during daytime and nighttime observations and best when skies were clear, because thermal radiance from cloud heat often obscured targets. The V-ERTRAD/TI system, though costly, is a valuable tool for measuring accurate bird migration traffic rates (the number of birds crossing 1609.34 in [I statute mile] of front per hour) for different altitudinal strata above 25 in. The technique can be used to estimate the potential risk of migrating birds colliding with man-made obstacles of various heights (e.g., communication and broadcast towers and wind turbines)-a subject of increasing importance to conservation biologists.",no,,13,58,61,1,42,J FIELD ORNITHOL,J.

Although LEVs have been visualized on real, physically modeled, and simulated insects, the physical mechanisms responsible for their stability are poorly understood. To gain fundamental insight into LEV stability on flapping fly wings we expressed the Navier-Stokes equations in a rotating frame of reference attached to the wing's surface. Using these equations we show that LEV dynamics on flapping wings are governed by three terms: angular, centripetal and Coriolis acceleration. Our analysis for hovering conditions shows that angular acceleration is proportional to the inverse of dimensionless stroke amplitude, whereas Coriolis and centripetal acceleration are proportional to the inverse of the Rossby number. Using a dynamically scaled robot model of a flapping fruit fly wing to systematically vary these dimensionless numbers, we determined which of the three accelerations mediate LEV stability. Our force measurements and flow visualizations indicate that the LEV is stabilized by the 'quasi-steady' centripetal and Coriolis accelerations that are present at low Rossby number and result from the propeller-like sweep of the wing. In contrast, the unsteady angular acceleration that results from the back and forth motion of a flapping wing does not appear to play a role in the stable attachment of the LEV. Angular acceleration is, however, critical for LEV integrity as we found it can mediate LEV spiral bursting, a high Reynolds number effect. Our analysis and experiments further suggest that the mechanism responsible for LEV stability is not dependent on Reynolds number, at least over the range most relevant for insect flight (100<14,000). LEVs are stable and continue to augment force even when they burst. These and similar findings for propellers and wind turbines at much higher Reynolds numbers suggest that even large flying animals could potentially exploit LEV-based force augmentation during slow hovering flight, take-offs or landing. We calculated the Rossby number from single-wing aspect ratios of over 300 insects, birds, bats, autorotating seeds, and pectoral fins of fish. We found that, on average, wings and fins have a Rossby number close to that of flies (Ro=3). Theoretically, many of these animals should therefore be able to generate a stable LEV, a prediction that is supported by recent findings for several insects, one bat, one bird and one fish. This suggests that force augmentation through stably attached (leading edge) vortices could represent a convergent solution for the generation of high fluid forces over a quite large range in size.",no,,69,337,348,5,99,J EXP BIOL,J.

A hybrid renewable energy system was integrated into the integrated structure to generate and store the direct current electrical energy required by the solid oxide electrolysis cell sub-system and other consumers. Modeling of solar dish collector, phase change material energy storage, and thermoelectric generator sub-systems were performed in MATLAB engineering software, while solid oxide electrolysis cell sub-system modeling was carried out both in ASPEN HYSYS and MATLAB software.

The influence of influential parameters on the proficiency of each sub-system was examined comprehensively through sensitivity analysis. The results obtained revealed that the amount of utilizable heat absorbed by the heat transfer fluid as well as the outlet temperature of the collector in summer was considerable than the amount of heat required. Therefore, most of the heat stored in the thermal energy storage sub-system occurred in this season. During charging process of the thermal energy storage subsystem 60.56 kWh of energy was stored. The output power of the thermoelectric generators increased with the molar flow rates of oxygen and hydrogen streams.

In this study, to determine the most reliable and economical way to meet the electricity demand of remote areas, an off-grid hybrid renewable configuration comprised of PV panels, wind turbines, a battery bank, and a biogas generator (as backup) is proposed. To this end, exergy and environmental analyses and techno-economic optimization are applied to four dispatch strategies including cycle charging, load following, combined dispatch, and HOMER predictive over a remote off-grid village located in South Khorasan province as a case study. The results of the exergy analysis signposted that for all dispatch modes, the highest share in overall exergy destruction was pertinent to PV modules, and accordingly, the inauguration of three solar tracking systems was examined. To investigate the cost-effectiveness of different configurations and dispatch strategies, a cost-effective index was defined and in all dispatch strategies, the highest belonged to the vertical tracker. On these grounds, the vertical tracking mode was the most cost-effective option to enhance the hybrid system's technical performance. The results indicated that upon forecasting the future load, the HOMER pre-dictive dispatch strategy was performant in terms of employing the storage system and minimizing excess electricity, while the Combined Dispatch elicited the lowest rate of application and appropriate use of the bat-tery. On the economic side, the cycle charging strategy had a cost of energy of 0.128 $/kWh and a net prest cost of $ 152258 and was found as the most affordable scenario with vertical tracking mode. Afterward, sensitivity analyses concerning the financial factors, exergetic parameters, and renewable resources were implemented for generalizing the findings of the investigation to other operating conditions.

Saunders's Gull (Lams saundersi), one of the vulnerable birds in the world, has become an important indicator species to measure the quality of ecological environment in the coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta.

In view of the successful application of satellite tracking in animal ecology, two individual birds were tagged for home range identification and habitat disturbance analysis. The gull's home range was confirmed using the Brownian bridge movement model. Habitat disturbances information from anthropogenic activities was analyzed by kernel density estimation as well as buffer zone analysis. Considering the gregariousness of the shorebird, the tracking sample data, though limited, can reflect the species' habitat selection to a certain extent.

Firstly, SGMD is employed to decompose the original bearing vibration signal into several symplectic geometry components (SGC), which is aimed at reconstructing the original bearing vibration signal and achieving the purpose of noise reduction. Secondly, the bat algorithm (BA)-based optimized IMSDE is presented to evaluate the complexity of reconstruction signal and extract bearing fault features, which can solve the problems of missing of partial fault information existing in the original multiscale symbolic dynamic entropy (MSDE).

Humans have changed the environment through disturbance, physical structures or additional resources. Many vertebrate predators inhabit cities, towns and other places that humans have built or altered, and make use of these anthropogenic niches. These predators range in size from bats swarming around lamp posts, to leopards stalking domestic animals in the heart of cities. In this essay, we describe four scenarios where predators opportunistically make use of anthropogenic niches. First, humans are surrounded by animals, including synanthropic rodents and birds, livestock and pets, that can be novel prey for opportunistic predators. Second, feeding on prey concentrations created through anthropogenic niches increases their hunting efficiency, by reducing both search and commute times. Third, anthropogenic environments create novel situations such as thermals and artificial lighting that advantage some predators, increasing their capture success. Finally, many predators have developed novel hunting strategies to make the most of opportunities in anthropogenic environments that can lead to greater hunting success. We give examples of these four scenarios and have developed a conceptual model that captures the common mechanisms relevant to each, with predictions for how these can be explored further in future studies. Predators exploiting anthropogenic niches can experience greater ease of hunting, decreased search effort and/or increased capture success. Consequently, these animals experience many physiological and reproductive benefits over conspecifics that do not make similar use of anthropogenic niches, ultimately benefitting from living alongside humans.

MOT are known for their simplicity and stochastic nature and successfully applied to solve complex engineering problems. Although there exist various categories of MOT, the techniques from swarm intelligence is reviewed in this paper. An explanation of the theoretical foundation upon which each algorithm is based is provided, along with the relevant mathematical models that explain how an algorithm attempts to obtain the best solution to a problem. The paper also reviews the applications of swarm-based MOT to the control of the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). Particular attention is given to control of the DFIG for wind energy applications. Control of the DFIG is generally realized via the use of PI controllers. While various PI controller tuning methods are well established (such as the Ziegler-Nichols and Cohen-Coon methods), these methods produce satisfactory results, and often fail to meet the stringent levels of control presently required. Due to this fact, as well as the current success of MOT in engineering, the application of MOT to the control of the DFIG could be promising area of research. The results of the study show that although the various swarm-based MOT differ from each other in terms of aspects such as complexity and advantages, they are all based on the concept of randomness, and always attempt to produce the best possible solution.

The facility was searched for evidence of large vertebrate mortalities over three months. Eight bird carcasses were recorded in the solar field, all of which probably died prior to the study period. Carcass persistence trials indicated that 94% of bird carcasses survived 24 h, 68% for 7 d, and 56% for 28 d, although persistence varied with carcass size. No large carcasses (>1 000 g) were removed entirely by scavengers after 28 d, whereas only 42% of medium-sized (100-1 000 g) and 17% of small (<100 g) carcasses remained after 28 d. Searchers detected 72% of bird carcasses, with large birds more likely to be detected than small birds. The extrapolated mortality rate for the facility was 3.9 birds y(-1)(90% CI 0.0-14.9) or 0.1 bird fatalitites MW y(-1)(90% CI 0.0-0.3). Birds were much more abundant (141.9 birds km(-1)) and species rich (51 species) in the surrounding rangeland than in the solar field (1.27 birds km(-1); 22 species). Of the 24 bird carcasses found in the evaporation ponds, six likely drowned (four species). Three reptiles (one species) and 12 mammals (seven species), including sensitive species such as aardvark Orycteropus afer, also drowned in the evaporation ponds. This is the first study of its kind in South Africa and unexpectedly revealed that the evaporation ponds had a bigger impact on wildlife than anticipated. Impact d'une installation solaire par concentrateur parabolique sur les oiseaux et autres especes sauvages en Afrique du sudCette etude a pour but d'evaluer la mortalite des oiseaux et d'autres especes de la faune sauvage ainsi que des changements dans la communaute aviaire au sein d'une centrale solaire de type Concentrateur Solaire Parabolique d'une puissance de 50 MW en Afrique du Sud. Il a ete realise une recherche de mortalite des larges vertebres au sein de l'installation pendant 3 mois. Huit carcasses d'oiseaux ont ete retrouvees au sein du champs des panneaux solaires, tous probablement morts avant la periode de suivi effective de cette etude. Les tests de persistance des carcasses ont indique que 94% des carcasses persistent 24 heures, 68% sept jours et 56% 28 jours, bien que la persistance des carcasses varie selon la taille de celles-ci. Aucune grosse carcasse (< 1 000 g) n'a disparu apres 28 jours alors que 42% des carcasses de taille moyenne (100-1 000 g) et 17% des petites tailles ont demeure apres 28 jours. Le taux d'efficacite des chercheurs de carcasses d'oiseaux a ete de 72% avec une probabilite de detection plus forte concernant les grands oiseaux que les petits. Le taux de mortalite extrapole etait de 3,9 oiseaux par an pour l'installation (90% IC 0,0-14,9) ou 0,1 oiseau par MW installe et par an (90% IC 0,0-0,3). Le cortege d'oiseaux etait beaucoup plus abondant (149 oiseaux/km) et diversifie (51 especes) dans l'environnement proche qu'au sein de la centrale solaire (1,27 oiseau/km ; 22 especes). Des 24 carcasses trouvees dans les bassins d'evaporation, six ont probablement trouve la mort par noyade (4 especes). Trois reptiles et douze mammiferes (7 especes, dont des especes sensibles comme l'Orycterope Orycteropus afer, se sont aussi noyees dans le bassin d'evaporation. Cette etude est la premiere de la sorte en Afrique du Sud et elle revele etonnement que les bassins d'evaporation ont de plus forts impacts sur la faune sauvage que prevu.",no,,58,9,9,1,27,OSTRICH,Ostrich,,2019,90,2,10.2989/00306525.2019.1581296,http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2019.1581296,,,9,Ornithology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology

In this species most social interactions between conspecifics are thought to involve mating behavior or territorial disputes. Developing a more complete understanding of the social behavior of this species would provide critical insight to address conservation challenges including high fatality rates from wind turbines during the period of fall migration. We tested the response of hoary bats to conspecific social call playback during the spring and fall migration to: (1) test whether conspecific social call broadcasting attracts or repels individual bats; (2) examine whether there are seasonal differences in these responses; (3) describe the structure and variation of recorded social calls; and (4) test whether conspecific social call playback can increase capture success. Hoary bats were attracted to social call broadcasting during both the spring and fall migration. Hoary bats produced social calls during the spring and fall migration, and when only males were present, suggesting a social function not associated with mating. While calls were variable in frequency and length, social calls tended to be a consistent upsloping shape. Attraction to social calls suggests social interactions not associated with mating behavior in hoary bats, and this technique proved successful as an acoustic lure to aid in capture and study of this elusive species.",no,,43,1,1,1,3,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,9-Jun,2022,12,1,10.1038/s41598-022-13645-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-13645-9,,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics
